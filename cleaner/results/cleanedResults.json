        "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration was close to transferring 11 detainees out of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to a country in the Middle East in October 2023, but abruptly halted the move amid concerns about political optics after Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel, according to four U.S. officials familiar with the planning.More than seven months later, the administration has not set a new date for the transfer, the officials said, and the detainees remain at Guantanamo with no clarity on when, or if, it will happen.The holdup has frustrated administration officials who said they believe election-year politics are supplanting President Joe Biden\u2019s policy of reducing the population at Guantanamo, and ultimately closing the facility. These officials said they are concerned the likelihood that the transfer takes place before November\u2019s presidential election diminishes the closer the election gets. And they worry the stalled process that has left 11 men sitting in detention for months without clarity about when they could be transferred could become a human rights concern.The 11 detainees are either citizens of Yemen or have ties to the country, the officials said. They were scheduled to be resettled in Oman, according to the officials.Several U.S. officials said the deal for their transfer is still under discussion with Oman, including on specific timing and conditions, and that it could happen this year. They said politics are behind the delay and that the transfer wasn\u2019t imminent because some logistics hadn\u2019t been finalized.A senior administration official suggested Oman also has at times since October not wanted the transfer to take place.\u201cThis is not like collecting dust somewhere. We\u2019re actively looking at all those administrative steps to make it happen,\u201d the official said, acknowledging \u201cthere are frustrations.\u201dThe White House National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment.Democrats and Republicans have objected to moving detainees out of Guantanamo, and the issue has been a political flashpoint through multiple presidential administrations. In January, for instance, the top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees joined their GOP counterparts in calling on the Biden administration not to allow intelligence community funds to help facilitate any transfers of Guantanamo detainees.Biden, like President Barack Obama before him, has worked to close the facility. But detainee transfers nearly ground to a halt while Donald Trump, Biden\u2019s predecessor and 2024 opponent, was in the White House.Biden administration officials working to close Guantanamo expressed concern that if these 11 detainees who were set to be transferred in October are not resettled this year, and Trump is re-elected, they will remain at the detention facility for at least another four years.Their transfer in October was imminent when it was called off at the last minute, according to administration officials involved in the process. The administration had already notified Congress that the transfer would take place, officials said, a step the executive branch is required by law to take at least 30 days in advance of transferring any Guantanamo detainees.The transfer would have brought the population at Guantanamo to below 20 for the first time since it began holding suspected terrorists in January 2002.Biden administration officials spent months negotiating the terms for the detainees to be transferred to Oman, including measures intended to guarantee the men wouldn\u2019t become a security threat and any possible compensation they would receive.Multiple U.S. officials said the decision to stop the transfer was not related to any concerns raised by Oman or last-minute disagreements between the U.S. and Oman. They said they believe it was the result of members of Congress, primarily Democrats close to the president, privately raising concerns about the timing.Most of the 11 detainees were cleared by the U.S. for release or transfer years ago, after going through the lengthy process to achieve that status.With Yemen locked in a civil war for nearly a decade, transferring them there was not a feasible option. While the fighting between the Houthis and Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, backed by Saudi Arabia, had largely quieted in 2023, the country remains unstable, suffering from a widespread humanitarian crisis and terrorist attacks from an Al Qaeda affiliate.Since the Israel-Hamas war began in October, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have attacked ships off the coast of Yemen in the Red Sea dozens of times. The U.S. and coalition partners continue to conduct airstrikes to defend against the Houthi attacks and to take out their weapons in Yemen.The deepening turmoil in the Middle East has made transferring detainees out of Guantanamo even more politically precarious, officials said.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration was close to transferring 11 detainees out of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to a country in the Middle East in October 2023, but abruptly halted the move amid concerns about political optics after Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel, according to four U.S. officials familiar with the planning.More than seven months later, the administration has not set a new date for the transfer, the officials said, and the detainees remain at Guantanamo with no clarity on when, or if, it will happen.The holdup has frustrated administration officials who said they believe election-year politics are supplanting President Joe Biden\u2019s policy of reducing the population at Guantanamo, and ultimately closing the facility. These officials said they are concerned the likelihood that the transfer takes place before November\u2019s presidential election diminishes the closer the election gets. And they worry the stalled process that has left 11 men sitting in detention for months without clarity about when they could be transferred could become a human rights concern.The 11 detainees are either citizens of Yemen or have ties to the country, the officials said. They were scheduled to be resettled in Oman, according to the officials.Several U.S. officials said the deal for their transfer is still under discussion with Oman, including on specific timing and conditions, and that it could happen this year. They said politics are behind the delay and that the transfer wasn\u2019t imminent because some logistics hadn\u2019t been finalized.A senior administration official suggested Oman also has at times since October not wanted the transfer to take place.\u201cThis is not like collecting dust somewhere. We\u2019re actively looking at all those administrative steps to make it happen,\u201d the official said, acknowledging \u201cthere are frustrations.\u201dThe White House National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment.Democrats and Republicans have objected to moving detainees out of Guantanamo, and the issue has been a political flashpoint through multiple presidential administrations. In January, for instance, the top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees joined their GOP counterparts in calling on the Biden administration not to allow intelligence community funds to help facilitate any transfers of Guantanamo detainees.Biden, like President Barack Obama before him, has worked to close the facility. But detainee transfers nearly ground to a halt while Donald Trump, Biden\u2019s predecessor and 2024 opponent, was in the White House.Biden administration officials working to close Guantanamo expressed concern that if these 11 detainees who were set to be transferred in October are not resettled this year, and Trump is re-elected, they will remain at the detention facility for at least another four years.Their transfer in October was imminent when it was called off at the last minute, according to administration officials involved in the process. The administration had already notified Congress that the transfer would take place, officials said, a step the executive branch is required by law to take at least 30 days in advance of transferring any Guantanamo detainees.The transfer would have brought the population at Guantanamo to below 20 for the first time since it began holding suspected terrorists in January 2002.Biden administration officials spent months negotiating the terms for the detainees to be transferred to Oman, including measures intended to guarantee the men wouldn\u2019t become a security threat and any possible compensation they would receive.Multiple U.S. officials said the decision to stop the transfer was not related to any concerns raised by Oman or last-minute disagreements between the U.S. and Oman. They said they believe it was the result of members of Congress, primarily Democrats close to the president, privately raising concerns about the timing.Most of the 11 detainees were cleared by the U.S. for release or transfer years ago, after going through the lengthy process to achieve that status.With Yemen locked in a civil war for nearly a decade, transferring them there was not a feasible option. While the fighting between the Houthis and Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, backed by Saudi Arabia, had largely quieted in 2023, the country remains unstable, suffering from a widespread humanitarian crisis and terrorist attacks from an Al Qaeda affiliate.Since the Israel-Hamas war began in October, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have attacked ships off the coast of Yemen in the Red Sea dozens of times. The U.S. and coalition partners continue to conduct airstrikes to defend against the Houthi attacks and to take out their weapons in Yemen.The deepening turmoil in the Middle East has made transferring detainees out of Guantanamo even more politically precarious, officials said.",

        "text": "A Pennsylvania teenager had to be resuscitated in March when he went into cardiac arrest after drinking Panera Bread\u2019s highly caffeinated Charged Lemonade, a lawsuit says.The suit, filed Monday and obtained first by NBC News, comes just under two weeks after Panera announced it was discontinuing the controversial beverage. It is at least the fourth lawsuit filed against the bakery-caf\u00e9 chain over the drink, which previous suits have blamed for two deaths and a woman\u2019s permanent health problems.Panera has denied wrongdoing in legal documents. It did not immediately respond to questions about Monday\u2019s lawsuit, which was filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.The complaint alleges that Luke Adams, 18, had no known health issues when he purchased a chicken sandwich and a large Charged Lemonade on March 9 in his hometown of Monroeville. That evening, Adams went to a movie theater with friends. While watching the film, one friend heard Adams making \u201cunusual sounds,\u201d the suit says. The friend then realized Adams had become unresponsive.Two nurses and a cardiologist who happened to be in the theater performed CPR on Adams, the lawsuit said. They also used an automated external defibrillator, or AED, to shock Adams\u2019 heart \u2014 which undoubtedly helped his chances of surviving, said Dr. Andrew Pogozelski, the cardiologist who has treated Adams since the incident.\u201cHe was about as close as you can come to being dead,\u201d said Pogozelski, chief of cardiology at Allegheny Health Network\u2019s Forbes Hospital in Monroeville. \u201cThis was about as unlucky as you can get for this to happen to an 18-year-old, otherwise healthy person \u2014 but about as lucky as you can get for people in the movie theater to know what they were doing.\u201dAfter being rushed to the hospital, Adams had two seizures, according to his lawsuit. Medical notes included in the suit said the seizures were of \u201cunclear etiology, possibly related to cardiac arrest secondary to caffeine intake from Panera Charged Lemonade,\u201d and said that \u201cheavy caffeine intake\u201d was identified as the only potential trigger for his cardiac arrest.Adams, a high school junior, said in an interview that he felt \u201cextremely lucky\u201d to have survived the cardiac arrest, which led to him being intubated during part of his hospitalization. His ordeal was first reported by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette several days before Panera announced it was discontinuing its Charged Lemonade.Charged Lemonade contains caffeine from multiple sources, including the stimulant guarana extract. Lawsuits have referred to the beverage as a \u201cdangerous energy drink\u201d and blame it for the deaths of Sarah Katz, a University of Pennsylvania student with a heart condition, and Dennis Brown, a Florida man with a chromosomal deficiency disorder and a developmental delay. Another lawsuit alleges it caused \u201cpermanent cardiac injuries\u201d in Lauren Skerritt, a Rhode Island woman. The suits are all ongoing, with the first set to go to trial in September.The Food and Drug Administration says healthy adults can safely consume up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day. After getting sued, Panera put more detailed disclosures in all of its restaurants and on its website warning customers to consume Charged Lemonade in moderation, stating that it is not recommended for children, people sensitive to caffeine or pregnant or nursing women.Panera also moved the Charged Lemonade behind the counter so it was no longer self-serve and updated its nutrition information to reflect how much caffeine is in the drink with ice. Previously, it had advertised its Charged Lemonade as \u201cPlant-based and Clean\u201d with as much caffeine as its dark roast coffee. But the lawsuits said that at 390 milligrams, a large, 30-fluid-ounce Charged Lemonade had more caffeine in total than any size of Panera\u2019s dark roast coffee, referring to the caffeine in the drink with no ice.Do you have a story to share with NBC News? Email reporter Elizabeth ChuckMonday\u2019s lawsuit said that when Adams purchased a large Mango Yuzu Citrus Charged Lemonade, which Panera lists as having 237 milligrams of caffeine in it with ice, \u201che was not aware that the Charged Lemonade was a super energy drink\u201d that contained \u201chigh amounts\u201d of sugar and guarana.Pogozelski said Adams\u2019 doctors could find no structural abnormalities in his heart and no underlying health conditions that would explain why he went into cardiac arrest. During his hospital stay, they implanted a subcutaneous defibrillator, a device that will shock Adams\u2019 heart if he has a life-threatening heart rhythm in the future.Adams\u2019 mom said she is traumatized by how close she came to losing her son.\u201cEvery night when I go to bed, the whole thing replays in my mind,\u201d said Lisa Feyes, an emergency room nurse. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard for me to watch Luke walk out the door.\u201dA Panera spokesperson declined to answer questions earlier this month about whether previous lawsuits contributed to Panera phasing out the Charged Lemonade nationwide, saying that the move came after a \u201crecent menu transformation.\u201dFeyes said she cried when she heard the drink was being discontinued.\u201cThey were tears of joy because no other parent will ever have to go through this because of a Panera lemonade again,\u201d she said.Adams\u2019 lawsuit seeks a jury trial and damages and accuses Panera of \u201cnegligence, carelessness, and recklessness\u201d in the design, marketing and promotion of the Charged Lemonade, among other allegations.Elizabeth Crawford, a partner at the Philadelphia-based law firm Kline & Specter, PC, who represents Adams and the plaintiffs in the three other Charged Lemonade lawsuits against Panera, said what happened to Adams was preventable.\u201cThis is a perfect and tragic example of why warnings are completely insufficient for this product, and why this product should have been taken off the shelves before the situation happened,\u201d she said, adding that Panera \u201ccertainly\u201d should have removed the Charged Lemonade after the first lawsuit was filed if not before.\u201cIt was a traumatic experience for both Luke and his family,\u201d Crawford added. \u201cIt was just so unexpected.\u201d",

But even the study\u2019s authors \u2014 who were prompted to examine the issue based on previous concerns about prenatal fluoride \u2014 say it\u2019s too soon to stop adding the cavity-fighting mineral to drinking water.\u00a0The new study found that women who had higher levels of fluoride during pregnancy reported later that their kids were more likely to have temper tantrums, complain of vague headaches and stomachaches and show other neurobehavioral symptoms by age 3.The study, the first of its kind in the U.S., comes as a growing number of cities are opting to ban fluoride in public water systems.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at the point where we are saying that water should not be fluoridated. It\u2019s generally considered one of the biggest public health wins, certainly for the dental community,\u201d said   study author Tracy Bastain, an associate professor of clinical population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.\u201cBut our results do give me pause,\u201d Bastain said. \u201cPregnant individuals should probably be drinking filtered water.\u201dThe study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, analyzed urine samples taken from 229 women during their third trimester of pregnancy. Study participants were predominantly Hispanic women living in Los Angeles and were part of ongoing research from USC\u2019s MADRES Center for Environmental Health Disparities. The center works to understand how a variety of toxins and other environmental hazards affect low-income and other marginalized communities. For the new study, researchers asked the moms to fill out a checklist to assess their children\u2019s emotional and behavioral health at age 3. Kids whose mothers had higher levels of fluoride in their urine were 83% more likely to exhibit a range of neurobehavioral issues, including anxiety, emotional reactivity and physical complaints, such as unexplained headaches and stomachaches, according to the forms the mothers had completed. The forms also included questions about symptoms that may be associated with autism spectrum disorder, such as a tendency not to make eye contact. While the kids whose moms had higher levels of fluoride had greater odds of showing behavioral symptoms, according to the study, Bastain strongly cautioned against interpreting the findings as anything more than a possible association.\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t mean that the child has autism. We don\u2019t even have autism diagnosis information\u201d for the children in the study, she said.  The National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0funded the USC study.Bastain said the research team wanted to look specifically at the potential effects of fluoride on childhood development because of concerns raised by other scientists. A 2019 study published in JAMA Pediatrics, for example, found that IQ levels were slightly lower in 3- and 4-year-old children whose mothers had higher measures of fluoride in their urine when they were pregnant. Dr. Mark Moss, division director of public health dentistry at the East Carolina University School of Dental Medicine in Greenville, North Carolina, expected the findings to \u201ccause a stir\u201d but urged caution.\u201cThis is something that deserves a further\u00a0look,\u201d said Moss, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cBut in terms of public health practice, no, this doesn\u2019t rise to the level of hitting the pause button\u201d on fluoridation.Neurobehavioral symptoms identified by the moms in the study did not necessarily meet the level of clinical diagnosis. \u201cTo say that there was an increase in odds for something that is  borderline subclinical, it\u2019s hard to say that this now warrants a reconsideration of public health,\u201d said Dr. Nathaniel DeNicola, an OB-GYN in private practice in Yorba Linda, California.Still, DeNicola,\u00a0who hosts a podcast\u00a0about possible effects of environmental toxins on pregnancy health, recommends that his pregnant patients use water filters to remove other potentially harmful chemicals, like pesticides. He was not involved in the new research.One strength of the study, DeNicola said, is that the authors made an attempt to account for lead exposure, which is well known to cause neurodevelopmental problems in kids. But lead levels were only measured during the first trimester of pregnancy and didn\u2019t correspond with the timing of the fluoride samples.The study had several flaws. The researchers couldn\u2019t say whether the women in the study drank fluoridated water. The MADRES study may not apply to other populations or areas of the country.

        "text": "The enormous container ship that collided with and collapsed Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge in March was removed from the site and taken to shore on Monday in a complex procedure.The Unified Command, a collection of local and federal agencies that managed the operation, said the ship became buoyant at around 6:40 a.m. ET and was slowly moved by tugboats to a local port.The Dali crashed with the bridge in the early hours on March 26, causing a catastrophic failure of the structure which led to the deaths of six construction workers and disrupted shipping across the East Coast and has remained in the Patapsco River for the last eight weeks.

        "text": "The enormous container ship that collided with and collapsed Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge in March was removed from the site and taken to shore on Monday in a complex procedure.The Unified Command, a collection of local and federal agencies that managed the operation, said the ship became buoyant at around 6:40 a.m. ET and was slowly moved by tugboats to a local port.The Dali crashed with the bridge in the early hours on March 26, causing a catastrophic failure of the structure which led to the deaths of six construction workers and disrupted shipping across the East Coast and has remained in the Patapsco River for the last eight weeks.

        "text": "Consensus is rare \u2014 but when it comes to skin care, dermatologists agree: moisturizers, like sunscreen, are a critical component of any daily skin care routine. They not only prevent dryness and irritation, but they\u2019re crucial for repairing and maintaining your skin barrier, according to experts we spoke with.\u00a0Finding the right formula for your skin type, texture and age may take a little trial and error, however. That\u2019s why we set out to find the absolute best face moisturizers on the market right now. Our staff tested more than 135 formulas over almost five months and ranked our top 100. Below, I share more about our testing criteria and methodology for creating this list, followed by our official ranking of the 100 best face moisturizers of 2024.SKIP AHEAD How we chose our contenders | What we considered | Methodology | Our ranking | Top 20Our final testing list \u2014 of 135+ formulas \u2014 was based on a compilation of our previous reporting on the best moisturizers for dry skin and mature skin, night creams, skin barrier creams and recent Wellness Award winners. Our team members also submitted nominations for products they regularly love and use and brands they were curious to try. In short, we did all the research and groundwork, so you don\u2019t have to.When considering formulas, we focused on day and night creams and excluded formulas with AHAs or BHAs, retinol and acids. We tested moisturizers with SPF and some without \u2014 we also tried a few options with vitamin C. For the most part, we focused on creams specifically designed for the face, though we did try some multiuse formulas you can use on your body, hands, and neck as well.\u00a0We also tried formulas across price points and included as many brands as possible. We considered drugstore brands, like Cerave and Cetaphil, with as much thought and care as more expensive options from brands like SkinCeuticals, Tata Harper and Biossance.\u00a0While our team\u2019s formula preferences differ \u2014 every member has their own skin tone, texture and concerns \u2014 we asked each of our editors to consider the same eight criteria when evaluating a moisturizer. Every entry could earn a maximum of three points per category, as noted below:Our team tried more than 135 moisturizers over more than four months in the depths of winter and early spring in New York City. (We received almost all of the moisturizers for free from brands as courtesy testing samples.) We considered every editor\u2019s skin type and assigned them products that would not knowingly irritate them. At least two editors tried every product. In doing so, every editor used each moisturizer for at least three days \u2014 both day and night \u2014 and then provided feedback by assigning points based on the above criteria as well as providing qualitative commentary. The higher the score, the better the product performed in our ranking. After using quantitative data to get an initial rank based on average scores, we adjusted the placement of certain products based on editor commentary, availability and price point. We tried to include brands only once on the list \u2014 only 13 brands have multiple entries. 100: Pink Moon Capricorn Moisturizer99: Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer SPF 5098: Monika Blunder Beauty Undercover Face Creme97: Jones Road Miracle Cream96: Indie Lee Retinol Alternative Cream95: Moon Juice Cosmic Cream94: EltaMD Skin Recovery Light Moisturizer93: Grown Alchemist Skin Renewal Day Cream92: Bareminerals Ageless 10% Phyto ProCollagen Firming Anti-Age Cream91: HH Science Balanced Skin Lightweight Oil-Free Moisturizer90: HH Science Antioxidant Facial Cream89: Alo Beauty Luminizing Face Moisturizer88: Derma E Vitamin C Renewing Moisturizer87: Rhode Barrier Restore Cream86: Jackfir The Classic Daily Facial Moisturizer85: Perricone MD High Potency Classics Retinol Recovery Overnight Moisturizer84: Revision Skincare D.E.J.

I have dry, sensitive and rosacea-prone skin and this is a great fragrance-free option that I reliably use in the morning. I like that it has a super lightweight, lotion-like texture that my skin quickly absorbs, making it easy to apply under my makeup. (It prevents dry skin flakiness from ruining my foundation, too). Admittedly, it\u2019s not the most hydrating moisturizer, so its not one I\u2019d use on my driest days or during the winter, but it does the job when I want something light that won\u2019t leave me shiny or greasy. The yellow tube is also transparent, so I can see exactly how much product I have left and know when I\u2019ll need to repurchase. \u2013 Mili Godio, updates editorSize: 0.5 oz., 2.36 oz. | Best for: normal, dry, combination and oily skin | Key ingredients: glycerinDermalogica\u2019s lightweight cream was great for my combination skin. In the winter, my face becomes bone dry \u2014 like that scene in \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d where he shrivels up and acts like he doesn\u2019t need water. This cream blends in easily and helped hydrate my skin during harsh winter days. I think it might have been a bit too lightweight for my skin, however. I noticed I would sometimes become dry after only a few hours, so it didn\u2019t rank higher on our list. \u2013 Jordan Bowman, commerce editor\u00a0Size: 1.7 oz. | Best for: dry, combination skin | Key ingredients: glycerin, squalaneWhen I first tried this balm, I was shocked by how quickly and easily it melted into my skin. I\u2019m prone to getting flaky, dry patches all over my face, especially during the colder months, and this moisturizer healed them almost instantly. It\u2019s occlusive, which means it sits on top of the skin and acts as a barrier to keep moisture locked in, so I only use it when dealing with really dry skin since\u00a0it feels oily (almost like Vaseline) and can get a bit sticky, which I didn\u2019t love. However, unlike other occlusive balms I\u2019ve tried, it\u2019s lightweight and easy to apply. I like using it on my hands nearly every day to keep them soft and hydrated, and the mini size is small enough to throw in a bag or pocket quickly. \u2013 Mili Godio, updates editorSize: 0.9 oz., 1.6 oz. | Best for: dry, sensitive skin | Key ingredients: shea butter, hyaluronic acidThe vibrant packaging was the first thing I noticed about this moisturizer \u2014 it made me excited to try what was inside. However, before I could try the cream formula, I had to battle with the moisturizer\u2019s push-pump applicator, which, in my experience, usually results in a bit of a mess and excess product coming from the pump at one time. This pump was more controlled than others I\u2019ve tried, but still gave me a little too much product with each use.When it comes to the formula itself a little goes a long way. It has a light, almost airy texture that spreads easily across my skin with zero feelings of heaviness (which is my no. 1 issue with most moisturizers).\u00a0Despite its lightweight feel, my skin\u2019s moisture levels lasted throughout the day. The natural finish also works well with balancing my skin\u2019s oiliness \u2014 however during hotter weather, I\u2019d probably reach for a less dewy option. \u2013 Ashley Morris, associate SEO reporterSize: 1.7 oz. | Best for: normal, combo and sensitive skin | Key ingredients: glycerinThe first thing I noticed about this cream was how small the tub was. The second thing I noticed was how great my skin felt with even a small amount of this cream. It\u2019s extremely hydrating \u2014 it absorbs instantly and doesn\u2019t feel heavy. As someone who is sensitive to the weight of moisturizers, that was a huge bonus for me. It\u2019s also unscented, which is something I tend to look for in face cream. Overall, it made my skin feel healthier and look less dull. It didn\u2019t resolve any of my acne pop ups or discoloration, but I also didn\u2019t notice it contributing to any sort of irritation either. - Rosalie Sparaco, senior social media editorSize: 1.7 oz. | Best for: normal, dry, combination and oily skin | Key ingredients: squalane, glycerinThis moisturizer is simple but still gets the job done. It has all the ingredients I want in a barrier repair cream, but unlike other options I tried, it has a lightweight consistency. It instantly feels dewy on my skin, and I notice that my eczema flare-ups have less redness and irritation.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t take up much space in my bags, either \u2014 but its small size might be a con for some. Since I have dry skin, I tend to go through moisturizers quickly, so I run out of this faster than my other options. I wish it were a little bigger for the price. - Bianca Alvarez, associate reporterSize: 1.86 oz | Best for: all skin types | Key ingredients: ceramides, hyaluronic acidI started testing this moisturizer in the transition from winter to spring when my skin was at its driest, and it kept my face well hydrated. The rich, thick texture kept my skin from drying out during the day and left my face feeling smooth. It\u2019s one of the few moisturizers I tried that I found to be actually fragrance-free, which is important since my skin is easily irritated. Overall, it\u2019s a dependable moisturizer, but I wouldn\u2019t wear it year round since it\u2019s rather thick. - Rebecca Rodriguez, editorial project managerSize: 1.86 oz | Best for: all skin types | Key ingredients: ceramides, hyaluronic acid, petrolatumBecause this moisturizer smells similar to the one my facialist uses, I am instantly transported to a spa whenever I spread this over my skin. The scent is mild, which I appreciate as someone who does not want to use a face cream that smells like a fragrant hand lotion. I only needed a tiny amount to cover my face (the brand recommends a blueberry-sized dot), and it didn\u2019t leak out of the lid\u2019s opening when I flipped the bottle over despite its thinner texture. It hydrated my skin and didn\u2019t irritate it at all. For about $15, I\u2019d throw a tube of this cream in my cart if I ran out and saw it at the store, but it\u2019s only available at Walmart, making quick refills challenging. - Zoe Malin, associate updates editorSize: 2 oz. | Best for: acne-prone and oily skin | Key ingredients: prebiotics, niacinamide, squalane, glycerinThe Water Lock Moisturizer from Tata Harper strikes a great balance between luxe packaging and efficacy. Its shiny gold lid, rounded container and the airless pump-style dispenser are reminiscent of high-end cosmetic brands. That said, the product isn\u2019t all looks \u2014 it\u2019s a good moisturizer for people with combination or oily skin, and it has a delightful yet subtle green tea scent that isn\u2019t overpowering. When I used this at night, it gave me a decent amount of coverage and moisture through to the morning, even around my nose and cheeks, where I get a lot of dryness. From a practical standpoint, the short cylindrical shape fits nicely in my small cabinet, though it retails for $68, which is more expensive than common drugstore moisturizers that come in bigger tubs. - Cory Fernandez, commerce editorSize: 1.7 oz | Best for: oily and combination skin | Key ingredients: peptides, hyaluronic acidIs it the sexiest product? No. But I love it so much that I bought the biggest tub available and proudly display it on my bathroom sink. When everything else fails me (and my skin), the Vanicream Daily Moisturizer will bring it back to life. It\u2019s on the thicker side but won\u2019t clog pores and is absolutely fabulous for my dry, flaking, peeling skin.\u00a0This is one of very few products that I will always buy again when it runs out \u2014 my skin practically craves it when it\u2019s gone. - Lauren Swanson, editorial directorSize: 3 oz. | Best for: sensitive skin | Key ingredients: squalane, glycerin, hyaluronic acidOne of the things I love most about this cream is that it\u2019s actually not much of a cream at all \u2014 it\u2019s so lightweight that it feels a lot more like a lotion, especially given how easily it absorbs into my skin. As a lifelong oily-skin girl, I always struggle to find a non-mattifying moisturizer that can keep my skin balanced and hydrated. I like that this leaves a slightly dewy finish that makes my skin look (and feel) refreshed, without any excess oiliness. I usually wait about two minutes between steps in my skin care routine, but this cream absorbed so quickly into my skin that I could apply my sunscreen almost immediately afterward. On hotter days it does tend to get slightly greasy when combined with some SPFs, however. \u2013 Ashley Morris, associate SEO reporterSize: 2.5 fl oz | Best for: normal, oily and combination skin | Key ingredients: lactic acidThere\u2019s a reason Olay remains a household name: During the testing process, I went back to this moisturizer repeatedly because it kept my skin hydrated, making it look vibrant and smooth. After using it once, I immediately\u00a0noticed a brighter, more even skin tone, and with repeated use I could see my skin becoming firmer and lifted. As someone with rosacea and eczema-prone skin, I am wary of what I put on my face, but Olay\u2019s Microsculpting Cream was gentle. I found the texture thin and lightweight without feeling watery, which made a little go a long way on my face and neck. The tub packaging lets me take just what I need and easily put back any excess. \u2014 Rebecca Rodriguez, editorial project managerSize: 1.7 oz. | Best for: normal, oily and dry skin | Key ingredients: glycerin, niacinamideWithout a doubt, this moisturizer from Cerave is one of the only moisturizers my sensitive, dry and eczema-prone skin can tolerate. It has a fast-absorbing, thick consistency (not\u00a0ointment-like, though), which made my eczema patches look and feel less like a desert landscape.\u00a0It\u2019s also free of common irritants (like added fragrances) and has the National Eczema Association\u2019s Seal of Acceptance, which gives me peace of mind because I know it won\u2019t worsen my flare-ups.\u00a0A little bit goes such a long way, so one tub lasts me a couple of months. Since it\u2019s in tub form, you have to scoop it out, which can be messy \u2014 it\u2019s one of the reasons it wasn\u2019t higher on our list. \u2014 Bianca Alvarez, associate reporterSize: 12 oz., 16 oz. and 19 oz. | Best for: normal to dry skin | Key ingredients: ceramides, hyaluronic acid, petrolatumWe love this barrier repair cream so much that we gave it an NBC Select Wellness Award. And for good reason: It has a thick, creamy texture so a little goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or heavy on the skin. Since I have moderate rosacea, I pay very close attention to what I put on my face \u2014 this cream fits the bill if you need a sensitive skin-friendly product. Not only is it fragrance-free, but it also managed to calm any redness, small bumps and dryness from my rosacea overnight. I loved lathering this on in the winter since it could get rid of dry patches that formed throughout my day by the next morning. \u2013 Mili Godio, updates editorSize: 1.7 oz. | Best for: normal, dry, combination and oily skin | Key ingredients: colloidal oatmeal, glycerin, niacinamideThe Belif True Cream Aqua Bomb is a recent NBC Select Wellness Award winner and one of the better face moisturizers I tried during this process. My skin felt like it was hydrated for hours, with no dry patches or flakiness on my face. It\u2019s lightweight, so I was surprised by how effective it was. I expected to blend it into my face without much noticeable change, but it worked almost immediately. My skin felt replenished and I kept turning back to this, even after testing other moisturizers. \u2014 Jordan Bowman, commerce editor\u00a0Size: 0.84 oz., 1.69 oz., 3.38 oz. | Best for: oily and combination skin | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, niacinamide As someone with oily and combination skin, I sometimes struggle to find a good overnight cream (or mask) that isn\u2019t too thick but still leaves my skin feeling hydrated. I usually shop around at Sephora and experiment with various brand-name moisturizers, so I was surprised by how much I liked this drugstore option. It doesn\u2019t feel oily or too heavy while sleeping, either. I love that my skin feels nice and plump when I wake up in the morning and it\u2019s a great price point, too. \u2014 Shari Uyehara, manager of editorial operationsSize: 1.7 oz. | Best for: all skin types | Key ingredients: peptides, vitamins B3 and B5, botanical extracts As a skin care fanatic, having the opportunity to test out dozens of moisturizers was really exciting \u2014 until my skin started freaking out. This Biossance gel moisturizer was one of the few that didn\u2019t cause me any breakouts or irritation, and in fact, was a formula I kept coming back to in between testing other options as a way to calm my skin down. It\u2019s genuinely fragrance-free, which I appreciate and has an instant cooling effect that feels quite heavenly on the skin. It has that perfect Goldilocks consistency, too \u2014 it\u2019s not too thick or watery. I only wish it was a bit cheaper. \u2014 Lindsay Schneider, commerce editorSize: 1.35 oz., 3.38 oz. | Best for: sensitive, dry, normal and combination skin | Key ingredients: ceramides, niacinamideI\u2019m very picky about what moisturizer I put on my face daily. I have dry, sensitive skin prone to breakouts, and since I use prescription acne medication (Tretinoin), I need moisturizers that are simple, hydrating and free from artificial scents and fragrances. La Roche-Posay\u2019s Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer meets all my requirements, which is a tall order. It doesn\u2019t have a scent and it absorbs into my skin quickly so that I can put makeup over it after about a minute. The moisturizer also spreads well \u2014 I only have to use a small amount at a time, so I foresee my tube lasting me a while. Plus, I threw it in my toiletry bag while traveling and its cap stayed closed the whole time without any issues. \u2014 Zoe Malin, associate updates editorSize: 1.35 oz., 3.38 oz. | Best for: sensitive, dry, normal and combination skin | Key ingredients: ceramides, niacinamideI\u2019ve tried many moisturizers during my journey on isotretinoin, commonly known as Accutane. My sensitive, dry skin frequently flakes and peels, so I flock to super-thick creams. The Glossier After Baume is just that and then some \u2014 it helps my skin\u2019s moisture level last all day, which is rare for me.\u00a0As a pro tip, scoop the product out of the tin and warm it in your hands. It blends better into my skin when it has a little added warmth. \u2014 Lauren Swanson, editorial directorSize: 1.7 oz., 4.2 oz. | Best for: dry and/or sensitive skin | Key ingredients: glycerin Under this bright green lid is a moisturizer that can handle any and everything: cracked knuckles, dry elbows, sensitive temples, you name it. Every time, it leaves my skin feeling refreshed, without a trace of fragrance or sheen.It feels thick and rich as it comes out of the jar, with an aroma barely registering on my nose. Everyone on our staff who tried this found it simple, reliable and nourishing, regardless of their skin type.It may not exactly scream \u201cspa day,\u201d but that\u2019s not the Cetaphil brand. It is a drugstore staple and a household essential for a reason: It\u2019s a cream for everybody and every budget. \u2014 Harry Rabinowitz, reporterSize: 1 oz., 3 oz., 8.8 oz., 16 oz., 20 oz. | Best for: dry and/or sensitive skin | Key ingredients: niacinamide, glycerin, petroleum jellyAt Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

We considered drugstore brands, like Cerave and Cetaphil, with as much thought and care as more expensive options from brands like SkinCeuticals, Tata Harper and Biossance.\u00a0While our team\u2019s formula preferences differ \u2014 every member has their own skin tone, texture and concerns \u2014 we asked each of our editors to consider the same eight criteria when evaluating a moisturizer. Every entry could earn a maximum of three points per category, as noted below:Our team tried more than 135 moisturizers over more than four months in the depths of winter and early spring in New York City. (We received almost all of the moisturizers for free from brands as courtesy testing samples.) We considered every editor\u2019s skin type and assigned them products that would not knowingly irritate them. At least two editors tried every product. In doing so, every editor used each moisturizer for at least three days \u2014 both day and night \u2014 and then provided feedback by assigning points based on the above criteria as well as providing qualitative commentary. The higher the score, the better the product performed in our ranking. After using quantitative data to get an initial rank based on average scores, we adjusted the placement of certain products based on editor commentary, availability and price point. We tried to include brands only once on the list \u2014 only 13 brands have multiple entries. 100: Pink Moon Capricorn Moisturizer99: Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer SPF 5098: Monika Blunder Beauty Undercover Face Creme97: Jones Road Miracle Cream96: Indie Lee Retinol Alternative Cream95: Moon Juice Cosmic Cream94: EltaMD Skin Recovery Light Moisturizer93: Grown Alchemist Skin Renewal Day Cream92: Bareminerals Ageless 10% Phyto ProCollagen Firming Anti-Age Cream91: HH Science Balanced Skin Lightweight Oil-Free Moisturizer90: HH Science Antioxidant Facial Cream89: Alo Beauty Luminizing Face Moisturizer88: Derma E Vitamin C Renewing Moisturizer87: Rhode Barrier Restore Cream86: Jackfir The Classic Daily Facial Moisturizer85: Perricone MD High Potency Classics Retinol Recovery Overnight Moisturizer84: Revision Skincare D.E.J.

I have dry, sensitive and rosacea-prone skin and this is a great fragrance-free option that I reliably use in the morning. I like that it has a super lightweight, lotion-like texture that my skin quickly absorbs, making it easy to apply under my makeup. (It prevents dry skin flakiness from ruining my foundation, too). Admittedly, it\u2019s not the most hydrating moisturizer, so its not one I\u2019d use on my driest days or during the winter, but it does the job when I want something light that won\u2019t leave me shiny or greasy. The yellow tube is also transparent, so I can see exactly how much product I have left and know when I\u2019ll need to repurchase. \u2013 Mili Godio, updates editorSize: 0.5 oz., 2.36 oz. | Best for: normal, dry, combination and oily skin | Key ingredients: glycerinDermalogica\u2019s lightweight cream was great for my combination skin. In the winter, my face becomes bone dry \u2014 like that scene in \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d where he shrivels up and acts like he doesn\u2019t need water. This cream blends in easily and helped hydrate my skin during harsh winter days. I think it might have been a bit too lightweight for my skin, however. I noticed I would sometimes become dry after only a few hours, so it didn\u2019t rank higher on our list. \u2013 Jordan Bowman, commerce editor\u00a0Size: 1.7 oz. | Best for: dry, combination skin | Key ingredients: glycerin, squalaneWhen I first tried this balm, I was shocked by how quickly and easily it melted into my skin. I\u2019m prone to getting flaky, dry patches all over my face, especially during the colder months, and this moisturizer healed them almost instantly. It\u2019s occlusive, which means it sits on top of the skin and acts as a barrier to keep moisture locked in, so I only use it when dealing with really dry skin since\u00a0it feels oily (almost like Vaseline) and can get a bit sticky, which I didn\u2019t love. However, unlike other occlusive balms I\u2019ve tried, it\u2019s lightweight and easy to apply. I like using it on my hands nearly every day to keep them soft and hydrated, and the mini size is small enough to throw in a bag or pocket quickly. \u2013 Mili Godio, updates editorSize: 0.9 oz., 1.6 oz. | Best for: dry, sensitive skin | Key ingredients: shea butter, hyaluronic acidThe vibrant packaging was the first thing I noticed about this moisturizer \u2014 it made me excited to try what was inside. However, before I could try the cream formula, I had to battle with the moisturizer\u2019s push-pump applicator, which, in my experience, usually results in a bit of a mess and excess product coming from the pump at one time. This pump was more controlled than others I\u2019ve tried, but still gave me a little too much product with each use.When it comes to the formula itself a little goes a long way. It has a light, almost airy texture that spreads easily across my skin with zero feelings of heaviness (which is my no. 1 issue with most moisturizers).\u00a0Despite its lightweight feel, my skin\u2019s moisture levels lasted throughout the day. The natural finish also works well with balancing my skin\u2019s oiliness \u2014 however during hotter weather, I\u2019d probably reach for a less dewy option. \u2013 Ashley Morris, associate SEO reporterSize: 1.7 oz. | Best for: normal, combo and sensitive skin | Key ingredients: glycerinThe first thing I noticed about this cream was how small the tub was. The second thing I noticed was how great my skin felt with even a small amount of this cream. It\u2019s extremely hydrating \u2014 it absorbs instantly and doesn\u2019t feel heavy. As someone who is sensitive to the weight of moisturizers, that was a huge bonus for me. It\u2019s also unscented, which is something I tend to look for in face cream. Overall, it made my skin feel healthier and look less dull. It didn\u2019t resolve any of my acne pop ups or discoloration, but I also didn\u2019t notice it contributing to any sort of irritation either. - Rosalie Sparaco, senior social media editorSize: 1.7 oz. | Best for: normal, dry, combination and oily skin | Key ingredients: squalane, glycerinThis moisturizer is simple but still gets the job done. It has all the ingredients I want in a barrier repair cream, but unlike other options I tried, it has a lightweight consistency. It instantly feels dewy on my skin, and I notice that my eczema flare-ups have less redness and irritation.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t take up much space in my bags, either \u2014 but its small size might be a con for some. Since I have dry skin, I tend to go through moisturizers quickly, so I run out of this faster than my other options. I wish it were a little bigger for the price. - Bianca Alvarez, associate reporterSize: 1.86 oz | Best for: all skin types | Key ingredients: ceramides, hyaluronic acidI started testing this moisturizer in the transition from winter to spring when my skin was at its driest, and it kept my face well hydrated. The rich, thick texture kept my skin from drying out during the day and left my face feeling smooth. It\u2019s one of the few moisturizers I tried that I found to be actually fragrance-free, which is important since my skin is easily irritated. Overall, it\u2019s a dependable moisturizer, but I wouldn\u2019t wear it year round since it\u2019s rather thick. - Rebecca Rodriguez, editorial project managerSize: 1.86 oz | Best for: all skin types | Key ingredients: ceramides, hyaluronic acid, petrolatumBecause this moisturizer smells similar to the one my facialist uses, I am instantly transported to a spa whenever I spread this over my skin. The scent is mild, which I appreciate as someone who does not want to use a face cream that smells like a fragrant hand lotion. I only needed a tiny amount to cover my face (the brand recommends a blueberry-sized dot), and it didn\u2019t leak out of the lid\u2019s opening when I flipped the bottle over despite its thinner texture. It hydrated my skin and didn\u2019t irritate it at all. For about $15, I\u2019d throw a tube of this cream in my cart if I ran out and saw it at the store, but it\u2019s only available at Walmart, making quick refills challenging. - Zoe Malin, associate updates editorSize: 2 oz. | Best for: acne-prone and oily skin | Key ingredients: prebiotics, niacinamide, squalane, glycerinThe Water Lock Moisturizer from Tata Harper strikes a great balance between luxe packaging and efficacy. Its shiny gold lid, rounded container and the airless pump-style dispenser are reminiscent of high-end cosmetic brands. That said, the product isn\u2019t all looks \u2014 it\u2019s a good moisturizer for people with combination or oily skin, and it has a delightful yet subtle green tea scent that isn\u2019t overpowering. When I used this at night, it gave me a decent amount of coverage and moisture through to the morning, even around my nose and cheeks, where I get a lot of dryness. From a practical standpoint, the short cylindrical shape fits nicely in my small cabinet, though it retails for $68, which is more expensive than common drugstore moisturizers that come in bigger tubs. - Cory Fernandez, commerce editorSize: 1.7 oz | Best for: oily and combination skin | Key ingredients: peptides, hyaluronic acidIs it the sexiest product? No. But I love it so much that I bought the biggest tub available and proudly display it on my bathroom sink. When everything else fails me (and my skin), the Vanicream Daily Moisturizer will bring it back to life. It\u2019s on the thicker side but won\u2019t clog pores and is absolutely fabulous for my dry, flaking, peeling skin.\u00a0This is one of very few products that I will always buy again when it runs out \u2014 my skin practically craves it when it\u2019s gone. - Lauren Swanson, editorial directorSize: 3 oz. | Best for: sensitive skin | Key ingredients: squalane, glycerin, hyaluronic acidOne of the things I love most about this cream is that it\u2019s actually not much of a cream at all \u2014 it\u2019s so lightweight that it feels a lot more like a lotion, especially given how easily it absorbs into my skin. As a lifelong oily-skin girl, I always struggle to find a non-mattifying moisturizer that can keep my skin balanced and hydrated. I like that this leaves a slightly dewy finish that makes my skin look (and feel) refreshed, without any excess oiliness. I usually wait about two minutes between steps in my skin care routine, but this cream absorbed so quickly into my skin that I could apply my sunscreen almost immediately afterward. On hotter days it does tend to get slightly greasy when combined with some SPFs, however. \u2013 Ashley Morris, associate SEO reporterSize: 2.5 fl oz | Best for: normal, oily and combination skin | Key ingredients: lactic acidThere\u2019s a reason Olay remains a household name: During the testing process, I went back to this moisturizer repeatedly because it kept my skin hydrated, making it look vibrant and smooth. After using it once, I immediately\u00a0noticed a brighter, more even skin tone, and with repeated use I could see my skin becoming firmer and lifted. As someone with rosacea and eczema-prone skin, I am wary of what I put on my face, but Olay\u2019s Microsculpting Cream was gentle. I found the texture thin and lightweight without feeling watery, which made a little go a long way on my face and neck. The tub packaging lets me take just what I need and easily put back any excess. \u2014 Rebecca Rodriguez, editorial project managerSize: 1.7 oz. | Best for: normal, oily and dry skin | Key ingredients: glycerin, niacinamideWithout a doubt, this moisturizer from Cerave is one of the only moisturizers my sensitive, dry and eczema-prone skin can tolerate. It has a fast-absorbing, thick consistency (not\u00a0ointment-like, though), which made my eczema patches look and feel less like a desert landscape.\u00a0It\u2019s also free of common irritants (like added fragrances) and has the National Eczema Association\u2019s Seal of Acceptance, which gives me peace of mind because I know it won\u2019t worsen my flare-ups.\u00a0A little bit goes such a long way, so one tub lasts me a couple of months. Since it\u2019s in tub form, you have to scoop it out, which can be messy \u2014 it\u2019s one of the reasons it wasn\u2019t higher on our list. \u2014 Bianca Alvarez, associate reporterSize: 12 oz., 16 oz. and 19 oz. | Best for: normal to dry skin | Key ingredients: ceramides, hyaluronic acid, petrolatumWe love this barrier repair cream so much that we gave it an NBC Select Wellness Award. And for good reason: It has a thick, creamy texture so a little goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or heavy on the skin. Since I have moderate rosacea, I pay very close attention to what I put on my face \u2014 this cream fits the bill if you need a sensitive skin-friendly product. Not only is it fragrance-free, but it also managed to calm any redness, small bumps and dryness from my rosacea overnight. I loved lathering this on in the winter since it could get rid of dry patches that formed throughout my day by the next morning. \u2013 Mili Godio, updates editorSize: 1.7 oz. | Best for: normal, dry, combination and oily skin | Key ingredients: colloidal oatmeal, glycerin, niacinamideThe Belif True Cream Aqua Bomb is a recent NBC Select Wellness Award winner and one of the better face moisturizers I tried during this process. My skin felt like it was hydrated for hours, with no dry patches or flakiness on my face. It\u2019s lightweight, so I was surprised by how effective it was. I expected to blend it into my face without much noticeable change, but it worked almost immediately. My skin felt replenished and I kept turning back to this, even after testing other moisturizers. \u2014 Jordan Bowman, commerce editor\u00a0Size: 0.84 oz., 1.69 oz., 3.38 oz. | Best for: oily and combination skin | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, niacinamide As someone with oily and combination skin, I sometimes struggle to find a good overnight cream (or mask) that isn\u2019t too thick but still leaves my skin feeling hydrated. I usually shop around at Sephora and experiment with various brand-name moisturizers, so I was surprised by how much I liked this drugstore option. It doesn\u2019t feel oily or too heavy while sleeping, either. I love that my skin feels nice and plump when I wake up in the morning and it\u2019s a great price point, too. \u2014 Shari Uyehara, manager of editorial operationsSize: 1.7 oz. | Best for: all skin types | Key ingredients: peptides, vitamins B3 and B5, botanical extracts As a skin care fanatic, having the opportunity to test out dozens of moisturizers was really exciting \u2014 until my skin started freaking out. This Biossance gel moisturizer was one of the few that didn\u2019t cause me any breakouts or irritation, and in fact, was a formula I kept coming back to in between testing other options as a way to calm my skin down. It\u2019s genuinely fragrance-free, which I appreciate and has an instant cooling effect that feels quite heavenly on the skin. It has that perfect Goldilocks consistency, too \u2014 it\u2019s not too thick or watery. I only wish it was a bit cheaper. \u2014 Lindsay Schneider, commerce editorSize: 1.35 oz., 3.38 oz. | Best for: sensitive, dry, normal and combination skin | Key ingredients: ceramides, niacinamideI\u2019m very picky about what moisturizer I put on my face daily. I have dry, sensitive skin prone to breakouts, and since I use prescription acne medication (Tretinoin), I need moisturizers that are simple, hydrating and free from artificial scents and fragrances. La Roche-Posay\u2019s Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer meets all my requirements, which is a tall order. It doesn\u2019t have a scent and it absorbs into my skin quickly so that I can put makeup over it after about a minute. The moisturizer also spreads well \u2014 I only have to use a small amount at a time, so I foresee my tube lasting me a while. Plus, I threw it in my toiletry bag while traveling and its cap stayed closed the whole time without any issues. \u2014 Zoe Malin, associate updates editorSize: 1.35 oz., 3.38 oz. | Best for: sensitive, dry, normal and combination skin | Key ingredients: ceramides, niacinamideI\u2019ve tried many moisturizers during my journey on isotretinoin, commonly known as Accutane. My sensitive, dry skin frequently flakes and peels, so I flock to super-thick creams. The Glossier After Baume is just that and then some \u2014 it helps my skin\u2019s moisture level last all day, which is rare for me.\u00a0As a pro tip, scoop the product out of the tin and warm it in your hands. It blends better into my skin when it has a little added warmth. \u2014 Lauren Swanson, editorial directorSize: 1.7 oz., 4.2 oz. | Best for: dry and/or sensitive skin | Key ingredients: glycerin Under this bright green lid is a moisturizer that can handle any and everything: cracked knuckles, dry elbows, sensitive temples, you name it. Every time, it leaves my skin feeling refreshed, without a trace of fragrance or sheen.It feels thick and rich as it comes out of the jar, with an aroma barely registering on my nose. Everyone on our staff who tried this found it simple, reliable and nourishing, regardless of their skin type.It may not exactly scream \u201cspa day,\u201d but that\u2019s not the Cetaphil brand. It is a drugstore staple and a household essential for a reason: It\u2019s a cream for everybody and every budget. \u2014 Harry Rabinowitz, reporterSize: 1 oz., 3 oz., 8.8 oz., 16 oz., 20 oz. | Best for: dry and/or sensitive skin | Key ingredients: niacinamide, glycerin, petroleum jellyAt Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

        "text": "Donald Trump's ex-attorney Michael Cohen admitted Monday to stealing from the Trump Organization during testimony in the former president's hush money payment trial.Cohen, who served as Trump's longtime lawyer and \"fixer,\" is continuing his testimony this week in the case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. The DA has charged Trump with falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. Bragg's case says the payment was intended to prevent her from going public about her allegation that she and Trump had had a sexual encounter.Trump has denied the encounter and pleaded not guilty to all criminal charges. He also has accused Bragg of targeting him for political purposes. Cohen is a key prosecution witness in the trial after previously admitting to making the $130,000 payment to Daniels.During Cohen's testimony Monday, Trump attorney Todd Blanche questioned him about a payment to tech company Red Finch. Cohen paid the company $20,000 from the $50,000 he received from the Trump Organization for financial services, according to Newsweek reporter Katherine Fung, who is covering the trial from the courtroom.Cohen admitted to billing the Trump Organization for the full expense even though he never paid Red Finch the entire amount. When Blanche asked Cohen if he stole from the Trump Organization, given the $20,000 Red Finch payment, Cohen answered, \"Yes, sir.\"Newsweek reached out to the Trump Organization and an attorney representing Cohen for comment via email.Legal analysts told Newsweek that the admission looks bad for Cohen as a central witness in the prosecution's case.Michael McAuliffe, a former federal prosecutor and former elected state attorney, told Newsweek that \"it will come as little to no surprise to the jurors that Cohen padded an invoice and kept the overage.\"\"The issue is whether all the evidence taken together convinces the jury\u2014all the jurors\u2014that Cohen's testimony rings true, that it makes sense, when it comes to his interactions with Trump as to the payments to hide affairs and disguise them as legal expenses,\" McAuliffe continued.\"Blanche's cross-examination of Cohen was effective to the extent that Blanche focused on Cohen's dishonesty and habit of seeking attention through any and all means,\" he said.McAuliffe went on, \"However, Donald Trump in 2018 in a video-recorded response to reporters' questions told the reporters that Cohen was his lawyer and to go talk to Cohen for answers about the payments to Daniels. That is just what the government is asking the jury to do now.\"Criminal defense lawyer Julie Rendelman told Newsweek, \"While Trump is known for his litigiousness, I don't see him, or the prosecutor's office, pursuing this any further. In many ways, Cohen's theft was a good thing for Trump as it further undermines Cohen's credibility in the hush money trial.\"Attorney Lance Fletcher told Newsweek that Cohen's remarks could bolster the Trump defense team's argument that Cohen's \"already questionable reputation is totally worthless.\"Matthew Barhoma, a Los Angeles attorney with Power Trial Lawyers, told Newsweek that Cohen has \"not been credible\" throughout the trial.\"The very hush money he was called to testify about he could not answer correctly, and hurt the prosecution's case,\" he said. \"Now, with this admission, I think new legal issues could loom for Cohen.\"Notably, Trump is under a gag order that limits his ability to publicly discuss witnesses, including Cohen, in the trial.Update 5/20/24, 3:29 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.",

        "text": "The complex ties between Iran and Azerbaijan have been thrust into the spotlight after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi died alongside members of his entourage in a helicopter crash following a trip to the border between the two nations.Raisi had attended a ceremony overseeing the opening of the Qiz Qalasi Dam with his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev on Sunday before boarding the U.S.-made Bell 212 helicopter to the Iranian city of Tabriz in the Iranian province of East Azerbaijan in the midst of heavy fog conditions. Accompanying him on the return trip was Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, East Azerbaijan Governor General Malek Rahmati, Tabriz Friday prayers leader Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Ale-Hashem and an unspecified number of guards and crew members.Aliyev was among the first foreign leaders to express his concerns upon news that contact was lost with the helicopter carrying Raisi somewhere over East Azerbaijan province. He offered prayers and stated, \"As a neighbor, friend, and brotherly country, the Republic of Azerbaijan stands ready to offer any assistance needed.\"A massive search and rescue effort commenced, with support from abroad, including Turkey and the European Union, and after the site of the crash was located, Raisi and all those on board the helicopter were declared dead.Aliyev then reached out directly on Monday to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling the event a \"tragic loss\" in which \"the Iranian people lost a prominent statesman who served his country with dedication and loyalty all his life.\"\"On this day of sorrow, I pray to Allah Almighty to grant patience and fortitude to the friendly and brotherly people of Iran,\" Aliyev said. \"We share in your grief and on behalf of myself and the people of Azerbaijan, I extend our deepest condolences to you, the families and loved ones of those who perished, and to your entire nation.\"Condolences were also offered to Iranian counterparts from Azerbaijan's foreign minister, defense minister, the speaker of Parliament and other top officials in Baku.Ties between the fellow majority-Shiite Muslim nations have fluctuated over the years, though relations had most recently been on the upswing at the time of Raisi's death.\"Despite all ups and downs for at least the last three years, thanks to political will of our leaders, and strategic vision, Azerbaijan-Iran relations are back to normal,\" Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Aykhan Hajizada told Newsweek. \"The meeting of May 19 between the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Iran, the commissioning and inauguration of important projects on the border was one of the important chapters in the history of Iran-Azerbaijan relations.\"\"We were deeply shocked by the tragic demise of [the] president, foreign minister and other officials of Iran as a result of a helicopter crash following the mentioned meeting. We mourn these heartbreaking deaths, a tragic loss beyond words,\" Hajizada added.\"At the same time, despite tragic events and disturbances, we believe it is important to take Azerbaijan-Iran relations forward, and Azerbaijan is ready to work with current and future Iranian leadership to that end.\"Hajizada further noted that \"Azerbaijan-Iran relations have historic roots, and these relations are an important condition for [the] well-being of our nations and for stability in our region.\"Newsweek reached out to the Iranian Embassy to Azerbaijan and the Iranian Mission to the United Nations for comment.Despite recent improvements, however, a degree of mistrust has lingered between Baku and Tehran on certain issues.Among the prevailing grievances from the Islamic Republic has been Azerbaijan's decision to boost ties with Iran's top foe, Israel, in recent years. Some Iranian experts and commentators have gone as far as to reference concerns over a \"second Israel\" being established in the South Caucasus.While tensions have risen substantially between Iran and Israel since the war in Gaza erupted last October, Aliyev only further boosted cooperation with the administration of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meeting Israeli President Isaac Herzog on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in February.The Israeli government did not immediately issue any official reaction to Raisi's death, though far-right Parliament member Avigdor Lieberman, head of the Yisrael Beytenu party, referred to Raisi as a \"brutal man\" and said \"we won't shed a tear\" over his death.United States-Iran frictions have also intensified over the course of the conflict in Gaza, but U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller offered the country's condolences over the incident while reaffirming \"our support for the Iranian people and their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\"Other concerns in Iran regarding Azerbaijan have been directed toward suspected ties between Baku and Azeri separatist movements in northwestern Iran. Iran is home to a sizable minority of ethnic Azeris, numbering up to a quarter of the population by some estimates and majorities in the regions bordering Azerbaijan.Majad Javadi Araz, a spokesperson for the separatist Azerbaijan National Resistance Organization, mocked the search and rescue effort for Raisi on Monday, noting that it was a Turkish drone that appeared to first locate the site of the helicopter crash. Araz also observed how Aliyev sought to link together \"the two coasts of Aras,\" the river that divides Iran and Azerbaijan where the two leaders met Sunday to inaugurate the new dam prior to Raisi's death.Meanwhile, Azerbaijani authorities have cracked down on pro-Iran elements in their own country, particularly those tied to the \"Islamic Resistance in Azerbaijan,\" also known as the \"Huseyniyun,\" a self-proclaimed part of the broader \"Axis of Resistance\" coalition aligned with Iran. As Iran and Israel exchanged a direct series of attacks last month, Axis of Resistance factions reported on the death of a Huseyniyun official in Azerbaijani prison.The Huseyniyun-affiliated Azerbaijan Studies Center also closely followed the news of Raisi's helicopter crash and accused alleged Israel-affiliated actors of seeking to create instability in the event that the Iranian president was declared dead. Following confirmation of his demise, the Huseyniyun issued a statement Monday congratulating Khamenei for the \"martyrdom\" of Raisi and his companions.Other complaints from Baku stem from accusations that Iran supported Armenian and allied separatist forces in recent conflicts over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.But Iran and Azerbaijan do share a number of common interests, particularly the development of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INTSC), an ambitious rail project that seeks to connect India to Russia by way of Iran and Azerbaijan. With tensions still simmering over the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and just days after war erupted between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Iran signed a historic agreement last October to establish the Aras corridor to allow Azerbaijan access via Iranian territory to the exclave province of Nakhchivan.The route would provide an alternative to the more controversial Zangezur corridor plan, which would cut through Armenia and potentially lead to further conflict and instability in the South Caucasus. The Aras corridor agreement marked a positive shift in ties between Tehran and Baku, which were further boosted during Amir-Abdollahian's follow-up visit to Azerbaijan in March.Raisi's border visit was viewed as yet another affirmation of warming relations between the two countries, during which Aliyev declared \"there will be many more meetings in the future\" just hours before Raisi's death would overshadow the trip.Prior to the confirmation of Raisi's death, Khamenei had vowed continuity in Iran's governance and has since named First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber as acting president per Article 131 of the Iranian Constitution, while nuclear negotiations chief Ali Bagheri was named acting foreign minister. New elections are set to be held within 50 days.",

        "text": "The death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in northern Iran has shaken the world and led to wide speculation about the circumstances.The helicopter transporting Raisi, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Tabriz Friday prayers leader Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Ale-Hashem, East Azerbaijan Governor General Malek Rahmati and an unspecified number of guards went down Sunday in Iran's East Azerbaijan province following a trip to the neighboring country of Azerbaijan.Search teams spent the day combing the area amid thick fog and icy weather before a drone on early Monday identified a thermal signal thought to be the wrecked aircraft. No survivors were found, and Raisi's death was confirmed shortly afterward.Rumors surrounding the president's death have begun their inevitable spread online, including unfounded allegations about the circumstances leading to the crash. Also, fingers have been pointed in terms of who might be responsible but without any evidence or support.Here is what is known so far.Iranian officials have not yet said what caused the crash, according to the Associated Press, although bad weather may have played a role. Thick fog was present when the helicopter crashed and during the search efforts.During the initial search for the crash site, Pir-Hossein Koulivand, president of the Iranian Red Crescent Society, said that its 40 search teams were working despite \"challenging weather conditions\" and that it was \"impossible\" to conduct drone-assisted aerial searches.Eventually, drones were able to find a fire that led to the wreckage, about 12 miles south of the Azerbaijan-Iranian border.It was initially unclear if Raisi and the others on board had survived the crash. However, search and rescue crews that reached the site on Monday confirmed there were no survivors, state media reported.Footage sourced from the Fars News Agency and the Red Cross showed what appeared to be the helicopter crash site, including the vehicle's tail in a wooded area.Following the news, social media was awash with theories about Israel's involvement but with no credible evidence beyond the current tensions between the two nations.While an official statement has not yet been released, an Israeli official told Reuters that Israel had nothing to do with the crash, saying, \"It wasn't us.\"Speaking to ABC Australia, Adel Abdel Ghafar, director of foreign policy and security at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said it was unlikely that Israel would have \"attempted such a move like this.\"\"This would be a direct act of war likely to provoke a severe response from Iran, and Israel's strategy has always been attacking Iran covertly, militarily and so on. And military targets rather than political leaders,\" he said.\"But if there is some sort of external power,\" Ghafar added, \"then this tinderbox can potentially explode.\"Elsewhere on social media, some users have claimed that the U.S. \"believes\" that Raisi was assassinated. This is not supported by evidence and appears to be merely engagement farming, a technique commonly used on social media in the wake of global news events to attract viewers or audiences to a channel, even with unsupported or phony claims.Newsweek has contacted the White House and the Iranian mission to the United Nations via email for comment.At this point, with the helicopter discovered less than 24 hours ago, there has been no confirmation of what caused the crash. While poor weather may have played a part, the circumstances are still under investigation.Raisi, a former judiciary chief, was elected president in June 2021 and was poised to stand for reelection for a second four-year term next year. His victory marked a major win for Iran's conservative elite, which has increasingly consolidated power in recent years, enhancing the influence of the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Following Raisi's death, Iranian Vice President Muhammad Mukhbar becomes acting president with the approval of Khamenei, according to Article 131 of the Iranian Constitution. New elections will be held within 50 days.During Raisi's tenure, there have been outbreaks of domestic unrest, including a series of nationwide protests that began in September 2022 after the death of a young woman who was in police custody for not adhering to the country's mandatory headscarf laws for women. In addition, insurgent organizations have struck within the country, with the Islamic State militant group claiming responsibility in January for the deadliest attack in the Islamic Republic's 45-year history as ISIS seeks to achieve a global resurgence.In an address delivered as the search and rescue effort for Raisi and his entourage was underway on Sunday, Khamenei said that \"the nation doesn't need to be worried or anxious, as the administration of the country will not be disrupted at all.\"",

        "text": "A Catholic monk came out as transgender this month, saying the church had \"to deal with\" trans Catholics.On May 17, Brother Christian Matson, a Catholic monk in Kentucky, told Religion News Service, \"This Sunday, Pentecost 2024, I'm planning to come out publicly as transgender.\"\"You've got to deal with us, because God has called us into this church,\" Matson told the outlet. \"It's not your church to kick us out of\u2014this is God's church, and God has called us and engrafted us into it.\"Matson's announcement comes amid an ongoing conversation about transgender and LGBTQ+ rights throughout the U.S. Companies and brands that have advocated for the LGBTQ+ community have received a backlash, such as the beer brand Bud Light, which faced a boycott after partnering with Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender activist.In April, the Vatican published \"Infinite Dignity,\" a 20-page declaration that discussed the Catholic Church's view on transgender individuals. The declaration, which was approved by Pope Francis, said God created men and women as biologically different beings, and that no one should try to alter that plan or \"make oneself God.\"The document describes gender-affirming surgery as violating God's gift of human dignity and as attempting to play God on the surgeon's table during a \"sex-change intervention.\" An exception was made for surgery to correct \"genital abnormalities,\" which healthcare professionals could help \"resolve,\" the declaration said.Newsweek has contacted the Vatican and Matson for comment via email and his website's contact form, respectively.Religion News Service reported that Matson converted to Catholicism in 2010, four years after he transitioned. Matson spoke with a canon lawyer, who advised him to consider becoming a diocesan hermit, but he was later rejected by many Catholic communities, he told the outlet.\"People who knew me said, 'You clearly have a religious vocation,' and these were all people who knew my medical history,\" Matson told Religion News Service. \"But when they would go to the people in the community in charge of making that decision, they ... would often just refuse to even meet with me.\"Matson's bishop, John Stowe of the Diocese of Lexington in Kentucky, told Religion News Service that he received a letter from Matson in 2020 and expressed openness to allowing him in his church.\"My willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church. Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female,\" Stowe told the outlet. Newsweek has contacted Stowe for comment via a contact form on the Diocese of Lexington's website.In 2022, Matson took his vows to become a diocesan hermit, under Stowe's direction, Religion News Service reported. He renewed his vows in 2023.Matson told Religion News Service, \"I became Catholic after I transitioned because of the Catholic understanding\u2014the sacramental understanding\u2014of the body, of creation, of the desirability of the visible unity of the church, and primarily because of the Eucharist.\"",

        "text": "The Biden administration on Monday raised questions about the application from the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor for arrest warrants for both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States rejects the ICC prosecutor's announcement for arrest warrants for Netanyahu along with Sinwar, adding that there are \"deeply troubling process questions.\"\"We reject the Prosecutor's equivalence of Israel with Hamas. It is shameful. Hamas is a bruta organization that carried out the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and is still holding dozens of innocent people hostage, including Americans,\" Blinken said in the statement.Division remains amid the Israel-Hamas war, which began after the Palestinian militant group launched thousands of missiles from the Gaza Strip into Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people. Israel subsequently launched its heaviest-ever airstrikes in Gaza. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, the Associated Press said. The rising death toll has led to international calls for a ceasefire.Karim Khan, the ICC's chief prosecutor, shared the news of the arrest warrants with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday. In a statement posted on the ICC website, Khan said: \"Israel, like all states, has a right to take action to defend its population. That right, however, does not absolve Israel or any state of its obligation to comply with international humanitarian law.\"\"We submit that the crimes against humanity charged were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the Palestinian civilian population,\" he said.In addition, Khan said that the court was also seeking warrants for Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as two other top Hamas leaders\u2014Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, the leader of the Al-Qassam Brigades, better known as Mohammed Deif, as well as Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader.The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant were laid out as \"causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict.\"Meanwhile, the charges against Sinwar, and other Hamas leaders, include \"extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention.\"Blinken stated on Monday that the United States \"has been clear since well before the current conflict that the ICC has no jurisdiction over this matter.\"\"The ICC was established by its state parties as a court of limited jurisdiction. Those limits are rooted in principles of complementarity, which do not appear to have been applied here amid the prosecutor's rush to seek these arrest warrants rather than allowing the Israeli legal system a full and timely opportunity to proceed,\" Blinken said.Blinken noted how Israel was prepared to cooperate with Khan, adding that the prosecutor was scheduled to visit Israel next week to hear from the Israeli government.\"Despite not being a member of the court, Israel was prepared to cooperate with the prosecutor. In fact, the prosecutor himself was scheduled to visit Israel as early as next week to discuss the investigation and hear from the Israeli government. These and other circumstances call into question the legitimacy and credibility of this investigation,\" Blinken said.Newsweek has reached out to the White House and the ICC via email for comment.Blinken said the arrest warrant for Netanyahu could jeopardize efforts for a ceasefire agreement.\"Fundamentally, this does nothing to help, and could jeopardize, ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement that would get hostages out and surge humanitarian assistance in, which are the goals of the United States continues to pursue relentlessly,\" he wrote.Anne Herzberg, legal adviser of the pro-Israeli NGO Monitor, condemned the decision to pursue Israeli officials as \"abhorrent.\"\"While it is unlikely any Israeli would ever appear before this kangaroo court, this case represents yet again the exploitation of international institutions in service of malevolent agendas,\" Herzberg previously said in a statement to Newsweek.Khan said that since last year, he had consistently said that under international humanitarian law, Israel needed to take urgent action to allow access to aid in Gaza.Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet with Netanyahu and Gallant, called Khan's push for arrest warrants \"in itself a crime of historic proportion to be remembered for generations.\"Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the nonprofit Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), previously told Newsweek in a statement: \"The arrest warrants for Israeli and Palestinian officials is a milestone in accountability in the face of decades of impunity for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Palestine.\"According to the AP, an ICC panel will now consider Khan's application for the arrest warrants, a decision that is likely to take two months to make.Update 05/20/24, 1:50 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Update 05/20/24, 2:14 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.",

The U.S.'s last known nuclear explosion test was in 1992, and the country has since adhered to a moratorium.The U.S., as the country that has carried out the most nuclear tests, \"has no right to comment on anyone's threat of nuclear war,\" the North Korean statement said.The ministry also pointed out the U.S. had deployed nuclear-capable submarines to South Korea last year, for the first time in decades, and is planning \"an actual nuclear operation exercise\" with Seoul in August.The ministry pledged the North would \"thoroughly\" safeguard the security and rights and interests of the state through strong deterrent measures in response to the evolving U.S. nuclear threat.\"Newsweek reached out to the North Korean embassy in Beijing, China, outside of office hours with a written request for comment.North Korea previously warned of a \"catastrophic aftermath\" if the planned joint military exercises, designed to simulate a response to Pyongyang's potential use of a nuclear weapon, proceed.North Korea, which has conducted six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017, has threatened a seventh and in 2022 updated its nuclear doctrine in 2022 to abandon its nonfirst-use policy. The country has also upped the frequency of its ballistic missile tests in recent months, including those it says can be equipped with nuclear warheads.The international community remains concerned about North Korea's nuclear ambitions. South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. have repeatedly called for stronger international measures and enforcement of United Nations Security Council sanctions meant to curb Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.Analysts suggest that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un views his nuclear arsenal as essential for deterring foreign intervention and strengthening his bargaining power.Tokyo, Seoul, and Washington have agreed to enhance their trilateral cooperation to counter North Korea's threats.In his memoir, released Saturday, former South Korean President Moon Jae-in recounted how Kim had \"sincerely explained his commitment to denuclearization\" during their first summit in 2018.Hong Min, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute of National Unification, told NK News, Kim's statements were likely aimed at manipulating perceptions while continuing to advance his nuclear capabilities.The U.S. Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.",

        "text": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar for their actions in the ongoing war in Gaza.An ICC panel will consider chief prosecutor Karim Khan's application for the arrest warrants, which also include Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as two other top Hamas leaders\u2014Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, better known as Mohammed Deif, as well as Ismail Haniyeh.The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant were laid out as \"causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict.\"On October 7, 2023, Hamas led the deadliest Palestinian militant attack on Israel in history, killing some 1,200 people and taking roughly 250 hostages. Israel then launched its heaviest airstrikes against Gaza. About half of the hostages were freed during a temporary ceasefire in November. More than 35,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in the conflict, according to local health officials.If the panel grants Khan's application and issues arrest warrants, 124 countries that have signed the ICC's Rome Statute would be obligated to arrest the men and extradite them to The Hague, Netherlands, if they traveled internationally.There are key exceptions to the treaty, including the countries of Israel, the United States and Russia. However, some of Israel's closest allies, including Germany and the United Kingdom, have signed the Rome Statute, which was adopted by the ICC in 1998 and entered into force in 2002.When asked about German officials potentially arresting a Jewish leader, especially behind the backdrop of the Holocaust atrocities and World War II, Dr. Iva Vuku\u0161i\u0107, assistant professor in international history at Universiteit Utrecht in The Netherlands, told Newsweek that it, likely, \"would never come to that.\"Vuku\u0161i\u0107 pointed to the example of Russian President Vladimir Putin being asked to \"dial in\" to a BRICS economic bloc meeting between Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa in Johannesburg last year.\"It's clear that this is politically very fraught in Germany,\" she said. \"I think Germany would do what South Africa did when [Vladimir] Putin was supposed to visit a BRICS summit last year, which is to kindly tell him 'not to come.'\"Putin was indicted by the ICC in March 2023 and charged with war crimes over the removal of children from Ukraine, which left South Africa, a signee of the Rome Statute, with a diplomatic quandary.\"It's almost like you invite your friend to your house, and then arrest them,\" South African Deputy President Paul Mashatile told the Associated Press last year. \"That's why for us his not coming is the best solution. The Russians are not happy, though. They want him to come.\"Washington's relationship with the ICC is complicated and has undergone several phases.The U.S. was one of only seven countries\u2014with China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar and Yemen\u2014to vote against the United Nations Security Council resolution to establish an international criminal court in 1998. Then-President Bill Clinton signed on to the Rome Statute that would serve as the basis for the ICC mandate in 2000, but the signature was never ratified and, his successor, former President George W. Bush, informed the U.N. that the U.S. had no intentions of joining the court.Ties improved later in the Bush administration and throughout the tenure of former President Barack Obama, who sought active engagement with the ICC, even as he officially opposed the Palestinian National Authority's decision to join the Rome Statute given that the U.S. does not recognize Palestinian statehood in its current form.The White House's wrath was on full display under the former President Donald Trump, whose administration pursued punitive measures against ICC personnel, including visa withdrawals and sanctions, after a case was opened over potential U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan. The case was eventually dropped in 2021 and sanctions were lifted by President Joe Biden.Though the Biden administration remained openly opposed to any efforts to prosecute Israel, the current U.S. leader ultimately supported the ICC investigation into Putin after attempting to set up a separate domestic court to oversee the proceedings in Ukraine. The Biden administration later made the historic decision last year to collaborate actively in providing evidence to the ICC on the issue.Now, however, the U.S. policy toward the ICC has once again been put to the test as Netanyahu faces potential prosecution over the war in Gaza.Vuku\u0161i\u0107 told Newsweek that countries that signed the treaty should feel a legal obligation to arrest individuals under ICC warrants, if it has access to the individuals.\"I think it's important for those states which purport to be supporters of international justice, and enthusiastic when it comes to prosecuting, say, Putin, to be principled and support the court in doing its work,\" she said. \"This is even more so when the court appears to be investigating allies.\"",

The aurora is not visible during daylight hours.\"The aurora does not need to be directly overhead but can be observed from as much as 1000 km away when the aurora is bright and if conditions are right,\" it added.The Space Weather Prediction Center also advises that to have a better chance of seeing the phenomenon, people should get away from city lights into a \"dark, rural surrounding\" and look north.It comes after the Aurora was visible in the U.S., including as far south as Florida, on the nights of May 10 and 11 after a rare powerful G5 geomagnetic storm, with bands of pink, purple and green appearing in the sky over many states.They were also visible across the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy, and even northern India, with millions of people around the world snapping the cosmic phenomenon on their phones.The northern and southern lights can be triggered by geomagnetic storms, which are disruptions to the Earth's magnetic field caused by coronal mass ejections of solar plasma from the sun. These CMEs interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, a protective magnetic field that surrounds our planet, sparking a geomagnetic storm.Geomagnetic storms vary in strength depending on the CME's speed and magnetic field and are classed on a scale of G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme).This geomagnetic storm on May 10 was the most powerful seen since 2003 when millions of people across the globe witnessed another G5 that sparked power outages in Sweden.Space weather forecaster Shawn Dahl said that while this month's storm posed a risk to transmission lines for power grids, the electrical lines ordinarily found in homes were not at risk. But it was also warned that satellites could be affected, disrupting navigation and communication services on Earth.SpaceX said at the time that its Starlink satellite internet service had been degraded, and CEO Elon Musk wrote on X that Starlink satellites were \"under a lot of pressure, but holding up so far.\"Clinton Wallace, Director of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, described this year's G5 storm as an \"unusual and potentially historic event.\"",

        "text": "The son of Iran's Supreme Leader, Mojtaba Khamenei, has been thrust into the spotlight following the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.The president died in a helicopter crash on Sunday and has since been declared a martyr by the Iranian regime and religious leaders.A presidential election is to be held in Iran within 50 days of a president's death, according to the country's constitution. First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber will serve as interim president until then.The fallout following Raisi's death could end up being more than the presidential position. Raisi was widely regarded to be the favorite to be the eventual replacement for Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who, at 85 years old could be nearing the need to endorse a successor.Attention now turns to the Supreme Leader's son Mojtaba Khamenei, who some experts have speculated could eventually take the top position in Iran.Former Department of State adviser on Iran Gabriel Noronha wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"The key takeaway is not really who succeeds Raisi. It's the fact that the next Supreme Leader is most likely Ali Khamenei's son, Mojtaba Khamenei.\"Internal pundits had believed the competition to succeed Khamenei as Supreme Leader was down to Mojtaba and Raisi. If Raisi is dead, Mojtaba becomes heir apparent.\"Mojtaba does not have a huge public profile, but the regime has long been accused of paving the way for him to take over.Khamenei has essentially denied this, most recently through a member of the Assembly of Experts\u2014senior officials who elect a Supreme Leader\u2014Mahmoud Mohammadi Araghi.In March, Araghi said in an interview with the Iranian state news agency ILNA that Khamenei was against the idea of endorsing his son for Supreme Leader because it would amount to hereditary leadership\u2014something the regime would face backlash for as the Islamic Republic identifies as a democracy and not a monarchy.Noronha said: \"A question is whether anyone else would rise to challenge Mojtaba in the internal machinations. If not, it's his for the taking.\"And then we are set for the Islamic Republic to open itself up (rightly) to accusations that it has effectively become a hereditary monarchy - just in radical Islamic clothing.\"This would make it harder for the regime to differentiate itself from its predecessor Pahlavi government.\"Newsweek has reached out to Noronha and to the Iranian Mission to the United Nations for comment.Critics of Mojtaba, the second of Khamenei's four sons, have expressed concerns over what they say has been his behind-the-scenes involvement in decision-making.During the 2005 elections in Iran, reformist leader Mehdi Karroubi wrote a letter to Khamenei about what he called \"Mojtaba's interventions\" in supporting Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was ultimately elected as president.Karroubi was voicing an opinion that others have also alleged, that elections are being used to clear the path of reformist candidates so no one will stand in the way of Mojtaba Khamenei ascending to Supreme Leader.When Ahmadinejad won a second term in 2009, the results were widely contested and a huge uproar was triggered in Iran\u2014and met with a harsh crackdown from the regime.Protesters chanted \"Mojtaba you will die, but won't be the leader,\" according to reporting from Middle East Eye, an independent new organization.Araghi told ILNA that those within the regime who are in favor of Mojtaba praised his extensive knowledge of Sharia law. He was born in the city of Mashhad and is a cleric like his father, meaning he is seen as a religious leader.Until the election, Mokhber will be helped by the Speaker of Parliament and the Head of the Judiciary as part of a three-person council responsible for organizing the elections.The Iranian government issued a statement on Monday, expressing its sorrow at losing what it called a \"hard-working and tireless\" leader, promising that there \"will not be the slightest disturbance\" in the administration.",

The fractures and bruises were consistent with injuries typically seen in child neglect and child abuse cases, the report said.The parents said she had not been injured in a fall during interviews with Miami-Dade Police homicide detectives. Floyd also told detectives the child was in good health and didn't have any medical conditions.The autopsy report revealed the child had fresh contusions, internal bleeding, large lacerations to internal organs and blunt force injuries. The manner of death was ruled a homicide.Floyd told detectives she placed the baby on her and Nathan Allen's bed the night before. She left the house the next morning while they were sleeping.A little later in the day, Floyd received texts from Nathan Allen about the child's wellbeing, so she returned home. She said the child was unresponsive when she arrived back at the house.Allen told authorities he fed the child, then went downstairs to clean dishes in the kitchen. When he went to check on her about an hour later, she seemed lethargic. He then contacted Floyd.Officials searched the couple's home and found it to be in \"disarray,\" with \"multiple holes in the walls the size of a fist as well as dents in the refrigerator door which appear to be shaped in the size of a fist,\" the report stated.Several instances of domestic violence had been reported at the residence, according to officials. Neighbors told police the couple was violent and threw people into walls or objects.Nalani Allen had a visit with a pediatrician two days before her death. She was underweight but there was no evidence of bruising or broken bones.Floyd and Nathan Allen, who were charged on Wednesday in their child's death, are being held without bond.",

        "text": "New data from polls by Yahoo and YouGov and Ipsos Mori reveal how Americans feel about the Trump hush money trial, with some concerning results for the former president.Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, last month became the first former president in U.S. history to stand trial in a criminal case. He was indicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records relating to hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels by Trump's then-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen during his 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels had alleged she had an affair with Trump in 2006, which he has denied. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges and said the case against him is politically motivated.The first poll, from Yahoo and YouGov, revealed that the most Americans believe Trump did falsify records to hide his hush money payments.Some 52 percent of participants surveyed said they did believe that Trump falsified business records to conceal a hush money payment made to the adult film actress, while 22 percent said they did not believe this, and 26 percent said they were not sure.The poll then asked if participants believe Donald Trump committed a crime by falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment, with which 47 percent of participants agreed.The second poll, from Ipsos Mori, showed that registered voters believe the charges against Trump are serious.It asked participants how serious they believe the four separate criminal cases against Trump are. In relation to the ongoing hush money trial, participants were asked how serious they believed \"falsifying business records around the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal during the 2016 presidential campaign\" was. Some 64 percent of participants believed that this was a very to somewhat serious crime, while 34 percent believed it was not very to not at all serious.Based on this poll, however, participants believe the Trump hush money trial is the least serious of the crimes the former president has been charged with.The most serious crime, according to this poll, was \"soliciting election fraud and trying to overturn the 2020 election results.\" Some 74 percent of participants believed this was a very to somewhat serious crime, while 23 percent believed it was not very to not at all serious.The third poll, again from Ipsos Mori suggests that a Trump conviction could be the deciding factor in the upcoming election.The poll asked participants how they would vote if the election were held today. Thirty-seven percent said they would vote for Biden and 36 percent said they would vote for Trump, with a further 27 percent saying they would vote \"other.\"The poll then asked how participants would vote if Trump had been convicted of a felony crime by a jury. In this case, 36 percent said they would vote for Biden, with 33 percent saying they would vote for Trump, and 31 percent for \"other.\"Finally, the poll asked how participants would vote if Trump was serving time in prison. In this instance, 36 percent said they would vote for Biden, and 29 percent said they would vote for Trump.Do you have a story we should be covering? Do you have questions about the U.S. election?

        "text": "In an opinion column in the Financial Times on Monday, Amal Clooney signed on with five other experts in international law by stating their case in favor of International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutions against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas military commanders.The ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, confirmed to CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that the court is seeking warrants on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity surrounding the ongoing conflict in Gaza.Clooney, a world-renowned human rights lawyer who has worked on a number of serious global conflicts and is married to actor George Clooney, was named among the experts who advised the ICC in seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.The ICC is also seeking warrants for Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as two other top Hamas leaders\u2014Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, better known as Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader.In the column published Monday, Clooney and the panel of international law experts said they came to a unanimous agreement that are \"reasonable grounds\" to believe the leaders of both Israel and Hamas have committed war crimes.\"The Panel unanimously agrees with the prosecutor's conclusion that there are reasonable grounds to believe that three of Hamas' most senior leaders \u2014 Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh \u2014 have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity for the killing of hundreds of civilians, the taking of at least 245 hostages and acts of sexual violence committed against Israeli hostages. The Panel also unanimously agrees that the evidence presented by the prosecutor provides reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu and Israel's minister of defense Yoav Gallant have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. This includes the war crime of intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and the murder and persecution of Palestinians as crimes against humanity. Our reasons for reaching these conclusions are set out in our legal report.\"The Financial Times column was also signed by Lord Justice Fulford, Judge Theodor Meron, Barrister Danny Friedman, Baroness Helena Kennedy and Elizabeth Wilmshurst, former deputy legal adviser at the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The panel was also assisted by two academic advisers.The panel called the ICC's announcement a \"milestone in the history of international criminal law.\"In a statement on the Clooney Foundation for Justice homepage, Clooney explained how the panel came to its conclusions.\"I served on this panel because I believe in the rule of law and the need to protect civilian lives. The law that protects civilians in war was developed more than 100 years ago and it applies in every country in the world regardless of the reasons for a conflict,\" she wrote. \"As a human rights lawyer, I will never accept that one child's life has less value than another's. I do not accept that any conflict should be beyond the reach of the law, nor that any perpetrator should be above the law. So I support the historic step that the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has taken to bring justice to victims of atrocities in Israel and Palestine.\"Newsweek reached out to Clooney for further comments via email to the Clooney Foundation for Justice on Monday afternoon.The international law panel's full report can be viewed here.In a statement released shortly after the news broke, Khan said he was \"grateful for the advice\" given to him by a panel of experts.Israel and Hamas have been locked in a war after Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Much of Gaza has since been razed in strikes from Israel, with many of its 2.3 million residents displaced.More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its strikes, according to The Associated Press, citing Gaza health officials. Israeli officials say that roughly 1,200 people were killed in the initial Hamas attack, during which a further 253 people were taken hostage.The United States is a top ally of Israel, but the White House has become increasingly critical of Netanyahu's military strikes on Gaza. Israel has also faced pressure from the international community. Several celebrities have spoken out on the conflict while others have opted to forgo public discussion of the matter.Anne Herzberg, legal adviser of the pro-Israeli NGO Monitor, condemned the decision to pursue Israeli officials, branding it \"abhorrent.\"\"While it is unlikely any Israeli would ever appear before this kangaroo court, this case represents yet again the exploitation of international institutions in service of malevolent agendas,\" she said in a statement to Newsweek.Meanwhile, Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the nonprofit Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), told Newsweek in a statement, \"The arrest warrants for Israeli and Palestinian officials is a milestone in accountability in the face of decades of impunity for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Palestine.\"An ICC panel will now consider Khan's application for the arrest warrants.",

        "text": "Footage of the moment Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's death was officially announced at the country's largest mosque has been released by Iran's state media.The Islamic Republic News Agency released the clip from the holy shrine of Imam Reza, located in the northeastern city of Mashhad on Monday. Raisi was declared a \"martyr\" following his death in a helicopter crash on Sunday, and the crowd can be heard crying out, shouting and wailing as the speaker delivers his message with a solemn face.\"With sadness, we announce that the master of ethics and lexical meaning, Ayatollah Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi, the servant of Imam Reza (peace be upon him), who three years ago, on the anniversary of the birth of Imam Reza (peace be upon him) became the eighth president of the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" the speaker said.\"He was martyred on the night of the birth of Imam Reza (peace be upon him).\"This is according to a translation posted by Daryo, a news outlet based in Uzbekistan that covers Central Asia and Afghanistan.Newsweek has contacted several translators and experts to verify this version.The Iranian regime had already released a statement about Raisi through state media, confirming the death and expressing its sorrow over losing who they called a \"hard-working and tireless\" leader.But this clip shows Raisi being declared a \"martyr\" to the Iranian people, giving him official recognition and an honor from the country's government.This title is typically given to people who the state sees as having died righteously, and is often handed to those who have died while defending their faith or country, such as soldiers who have fallen in war.The announcement took place where it did because Raisi was originally from Mashhad and was a servant of the Imam Reza Holy Shrine when he was alive.The death fell over the birthday anniversary of Imam Reza, the eighth Shi'ite Holy Imam, who is an important figure in Iran. Several mourners have commented on this, believing it may have religious significance.In 2017, hundreds of thousands of people rallied in Mashhad for Raisi when he was still just a candidate.Footage from then shows them waving Iranian flags in support of a leader they saw as a representative of conservative values.There have been mixed reactions to the death of Raisi, who was known as the \"Butcher of Tehran\" to some for his reputation after his alleged role as one of the judges who oversaw the execution of thousands of political prisoners in the late 1980s following the Iran-Iraq war.Many supporters of the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom uprising have posted celebratory videos and messages on social media.Washington-based activist Sarah Raviani posted a clip of several people who died in the aftermath of the protests and wrote: \"My thoughts are with the countless victims of the Islamic Republic \u2013 those whose lives were taken due to the crimes of Ali Khamenei and Ebrahim Raisi.\"Their futures were stolen and many endured untold suffering in their final moments. We will always remember our heroes.\"But others are mourning a man they see as a prominent leader in the Middle East.\nHamas praised him for supporting the Palestinian cause and conveyed its \"deepest condolences for the immense loss.\"Similarly, the head of Yemen's Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Committee wrote: \"We ask God to grant their families patience and solace. Verily we belong to Allah and to Him we shall return. The Iranian people will remain adhering to the loyal leaders of their people, by God's will.\"",

Greene told her: \"I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading.\" Crockett's retort later went viral after she implied that Greene had a \"bleach blonde, bad built, butch body.\"Crockett has now revealed that she plans to use the alliterative insult\u2014dubbed \"B6\" and turned into memes and songs across social media\u2014as a slogan on a T-shirt that will be part of a clothing line called the \"Crockett Clapback Collection.\" The merchandise will help raise funds for Democratic candidates during the run-up to the election, she said.But a photo she shared of the T-shirt on X (formerly Twitter) ahead of its launch sparked amusement when eagle-eyed users noticed her name was spelled \"Crockrtt\" in the attribution beneath her quote.The politician shared the news about her merchandise line on Saturday. \"So we are going to drop 'A Crockett Clapback Collection.' This collection will feature various swag that includes random things I've said. The money will go to ensuring that we have a Democratic House! Give me a little time to really get the swag online etc., but B6 will drop first. If you have things you want to see come to life let me know. Post graphics or just phrases that you want to see. #bleachblondbadbuiltbutchbody.\"The black T-shirt featured white text, in capitals and list form, reading: \"BLEACH BLONDE BAD BUILT BUTCH BODY\" while an attribution below in italicized text read, \"A Crockrtt Clapback,\" apparently dropping the letter E in the congresswoman's surname and replacing it with the letter R.Some fans celebrated the move to launch merchandise, with one X user writing: \"This will be stuff of legend. But before people forget, Marge started it. Jasmine finished it.\" Several followers called her \"Queen,\" and one wrote: \"We love you, Jasmine.\"But others criticized her, with one saying: \"This is why nobody will ever take you seriously. The left may applaud you, but inside, nobody considers you a serious lawmaker.\" Others unfavorably contrasted her firing insults at Greene during a professional meeting with former First Lady Michelle Obama's belief that \"when they go low, we go high.\" She should have risen above Greene's barb and not taken the bait, some suggested.Crockett's announcement was derailed somewhat as she was mocked when social media commentators noticed the misspelling of her surname on the shirt.One user asked her, \"Who's Crockrtt???\" with a close-up of the spelling. Crockett told the user: \"Order a shirt and you will see,\" with an emoji of an upside-down smiley face.Newsweek has reached out by email to Crockett requesting comment on the misspelled name on her \"B6\" T-shirt.Other X users shared screengrabs of her launch post, with close-ups showing the error. One wrote: \"Jasmine Crockett @JasmineForUS is now selling merchandise featuring her congressional meltdowns called the 'Crockett Clapback Collection'. Of course, she MISSPELLED her last name on the shirts as 'CrockRtt'. This low-IQ marvel even sucks at grifting.\"Another added she was being \"mocked into next week,\" while one joked she must score \"lower than a sponge on an IQ test.\"Crockett's insult and her subsequent move to turn it into merchandise stemmed from last week's fiery committee meeting. Greene told Crockett: 'I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading.\" Her comments sparked outrage in the meeting amid calls for her words to be struck from the record.Crockett subsequently fired back by asking committee Chairman James Comer about what constituted a personal attack. She did not name Greene, but said: \"If someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleach blonde, bad built, butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct?\"The exchange went viral, with Crockett's phrase being widely shared on social media. Crockett even went on to share some songs created using her insult as a lyric. One country song she shared with her 310,000 followers from her \"JasmineForUS\" X account, featuring a tune by an X user named TN Brando, was re-shared more than 12,000 times.Crockett has slammed Greene by saying her initial insult about her eyelashes was \"racist.\"During an appearance on CNN's State of the Union Sunday, she said: \"MAGA has historically been on social media doing the things where they're saying 'oh she's Black with lashes and nails and hair and so she's ghetto.' To me, this was her buying into that rhetoric and trying to amplifying this for the MAGA crowd, and so yeah, I absolutely think that she only did it to be racist towards me.\"Newsweek has reached out by email to Greene seeking comment on Crockett's allegation of racism, as well as a response to Crockett's plans for a merchandise line based on her retort.",

        "text": "\"The View\" hosts slammed hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and his apology after a recently released 2016 surveillance video shows him assaulting his then-girlfriend at a Los Angeles hotel.Host Ana Navarro Navarro also faulted the people around Combs who have justified his actions for years.\"Shame on all the people around Sean Combs who have enabled, justified and looked the other away on all of this type of behavior for decades,\" she said during Monday's episode of the ABC talk show.Host Whoopi Goldberg warned viewers of the \"disturbing footage\" before showing the video of Combs beating his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura at the InterContinental Hotel in Century City.Combs appears to chase after Ventura, wearing only a towel and socks. He grabs the back of her neck and throws her to the ground. He is then seen kicking and dragging Ventura.Combs leaves for a brief period before returning to shove Ventura and throw an object in her direction.An apology video released over the weekend by Combs on Instagram was also shown.\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" Combs said in the video. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry.\"Goldberg asked the studio audience if the apology changes anything, and they responded with a resounding \"No!\"The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said they \"would be unable to charge\" Combs for the incident since it happened beyond the amount of time that can be prosecuted.Host Sunny Hostin explained that the statute of limitations to file charges has passed.\"The statute of limitations for felony assault is about 3 years in most states and the statute of limitations for misdemeanor assault is about a year and a half,\" Hostin said. \"So it's unfortunate, the law has not caught up with this kind of thing.\"Navarro said it is now up to the public to determine how Combs is treated going forward.\"The LAPD may not be able to charge him, but we are able to shun him,\" Navarro said. \"And he should be treated like the leper, the social leper and criminal he is. We saw his commit assault. And I don't want to see him in any restaurant. I don't want to see him in any award show. I'm not going to buy any brand he's associated with.\"Host Alyssa Farah Griffin addressed people who have questioned why Ventura stayed with Combs for several years, despite her abuse allegations.\"I once was a victim of domestic abuse in a prior relationship,\" Griffin said. \"It happened once. I was one of the lucky ones where the power dynamics were in my favor that I could leave. I could walk away. I could remove myself from him. In the vast majority of cases, that is not the case.\"She said abusers will often use financial abuse, emotional abuse and manipulation to overpower the victim.\"This is a multi-millionaire, incredibly powerful, incredibly well-connected person,\" Griffin said. \"There's an entire industry of making money off of him. She had no hope to get away from him.\"Hostin also mentioned the age gap between Ventura and Combs. Ventura met Combs when she was 19 and he was 37. They began dating about two years later.The hosts also attacked Combs' apology, pointing out that he never mentioned Ventura by name in the video.\"It's easier to be sorry after people found that you lied,\" Goldberg said.Navarro also read a statement released by Combs in December of 2023 where he maintained his innocence after several lawsuits were filed against him, including one by Ventura. After Navarro read it, she angrily ripped up her cue card.",

But with no end in sight to the war, Ukrainian officials see little other choice apart from to piece back together the city, and the region, although it lies firmly in Russia's crosshairs.Many residents have moved around the Kharkiv region to avoid the brunt of Russia's push. More than 10,500 people have been evacuated from several parts of the region since Moscow opened up the new front, governor Syniehubov said on Monday.But some people who had fled Kharkiv have now returned to the regional capital, Ananchenko said. Some have remained throughout, and \"they continue to live their lives,\" he added.Other officials say the same. \"Despite everything, you can see the city is alive, that no one is running away,\" Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov told CNN.Ukraine's military has stressed the situation is \"dynamic.\" Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, told Agence France-Presse late last week that Kyiv had \"to be sober and understand that they are going deeper into our territory.\"Recent attacks may only be a \"first wave,\" Zelensky warned. On a future attack on the city of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian leader added that Russia understood that Ukraine \"will fight for a long time\" to preserve the settlement.",

        "text": "Vladimir Putin vowed during an emergency meeting to do \"whatever is necessary,\" as reports emerged of the Iranian president's fatal helicopter crash, Tehran's envoy to Moscow has told.Russia's president met with Iranian ambassador Kazem Jalali late on Sunday, state media reported, after reports emerged a helicopter transporting President Ebrahim Raisi, 63, had crashed in heavy fog over mountains in Iran's East Azerbaijan province.All aboard, including Iran Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, 60, are feared dead.\"Mr. Putin first addressed me and told that we were very saddened by the Iran president's helicopter accident and we will do whatever is necessary to help,\" Jalali told Islamic Republic News Agency, the official news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in a report published early hours Monday.Russia and Iran have deepened their ties since the start of Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Tehran has supplied Moscow's forces with Shahed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) throughout the conflict.Early on Monday morning local time, Turkish authorities released footage from a drone it provided which identified a thermal signal that they \"suspected to be wreckage of helicopter.\"An unnamed senior Iranian official told Reuters that the Bell 212 helicopter carrying Iran's president and foreign minister was completely burnt in the crash on Sunday.\"President Raisi, the foreign minister and all the passengers in the helicopter were killed in the crash,\" the official said.The aircraft was also carrying Tabriz Friday prayers leader Ayatollah Mohammed Ali Ale-Hashem, East Azerbaijan Governor-General Malek Rahmati and an unspecified number of guards and crew members.The Russian leader said the Kremlin was \"very worried and upset,\" Jalali said of his meeting with Putin. \"Be sure to convey my message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution that we are ready to do whatever is necessary,\" Jalali quoted Putin.Russia has said it prepared two aircraft, 50 personnel and equipment to help.The meeting was also attended by Russia's newly appointed defense minister, Andrey Belousov; Secretary of the National Security Council Sergei Shoigu; Chief of the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov; Minister of Civil Defense, Emergencies and Disaster Relief Alexander Korenkov; special assistant to the president, Igor Levitin, and a senior official of the Federal Security Organization, Jalali noted.Anton Gerashchenko, a former adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, said he believes Putin was \"terrified\" by the news of the helicopter crash.\"Raisi going missing can mean serious problems in carrying out the agreements between the two countries, including weapons and drone supplies,\" said Gerashchenko in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"There have been reports that the deal on drones was made personally by Raisi and his people from Iranian side, and Shoigu from the Russian side.\"\"[Putin] is known for his paranoia. And he surely sees the situation through his own fears. His paranoiac tendencies are well known\u2014he has self-isolated for months during the pandemic, he is guarded better than virtually any other politician,\" he added. \"Consequently, this fear might well lead to Putin becoming even more closed-off and intensifying the search for 'conspiracies' around him.\"The Kremlin on Monday published a statement from Putin expressing his \"deepest condolences\" to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Raisi made \"an invaluable personal contribution to the development of good neighborly relations between our countries and made great efforts to bring them to the level of strategic partnership,\" he said.\"I had the opportunity to meet Seyed Ebrahim Raisi several times, and I will forever retain the fondest memory of this wonderful man,\" Putin added.Iran's three branches of government held an extraordinary meeting on Monday, with First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber, 68, representing the executive branch, local media reported.In line with the Islamic Republic's constitution, if a president dies in office, the first vice president assumes the position of president for an interim period of 50 days if given the green light from the supreme leader. A presidential election is to be organized following this period.",

Newsweek has reached out to the Ukrainian navy and Russian Defense Ministry for comment.On Sunday, Ukraine's navy said Kyiv had destroyed the Russian minesweeper Kovrovets overnight, but did not offer further details.\"Another bad day for the [R]ussian Black Sea Fleet,\" Ukraine's Defense Ministry said in a post to social media. Ukrainian forces did not specify where the Russian vessel was located.Russia had used occupied Crimea as its primary Black Sea base, but consistent Ukrainian strikes\u2014and substantial Russian naval losses\u2014forced Moscow to relocate many of its assets further east in the Black Sea, including to its Novorossiysk base in Russia's Krasnodar region.Western intelligence has evaluated that Russia has restricted its activity in the western Black Sea, where Ukraine can more easily threaten its fleet.Ukraine's Navy said back in March that it had disabled or destroyed around a third of the Black Sea Fleet.\"The navy has suffered significantly in the Black Sea,\" U.S. European Command chief, General Christopher Cavoli, said in April.Ukraine has targeted a number of Russian vessels since the start of the year, including landing ships and a missile-armed corvette.Moscow has attempted to fortify its Black Sea bases against Ukrainian drones and missile attacks, using decoys to try to confuse Kyiv's operators, the British government previously assessed. Moscow has also announced it will beef up the protection around its Black Sea fleet with large-caliber machine guns to shoot down incoming naval drones before they strike Russian vessels.Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian navy, said in late March that Russia had just one combat vessel left in Crimea, which Moscow has controlled for a decade since it annexed the territory from Kyiv. The Tsiklon remained stationed around the peninsula, Pletenchuk said.The Tsiklon is a Karakurt-class corvette that joined the Black Sea Fleet in July 2023, according to Russian state media. It can fire Kalibr cruise missiles, and was built in the Crimean city of Kerch, the state-run Tass news agency reported.",

The attack likely took place off the coast of occupied Crimea, where much of the Russian navy's Black Sea fleet was stationed, although an exact location has not been confirmed.The ship was crewed by 68 individuals and falls under the Project 266 Akvamarin class, also called the Yurka class by NATO. Designed in the former Soviet Union, the ship was capable of detecting mines at depths of up to 150 meters and was equipped with two 30mm AK-230M naval guns and a high-resolution Lynx radar system, according to a report by the Kyiv Independent.The fate of the crew, if any were onboard at the time of the attack, was not specified in the update, but more than 1,000 Russian losses on Saturday have been claimed by Ukraine. The update also does not clarify what weapons were used to destroy the Kovrovets.Newsweek has contacted Ukraine's Ministry of Defense for clarification via email.\"Another bad day for the Russian Black Sea fleet,\" Ukraine's Ministry of Defense wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"Great job, warriors!Russia's Black Sea fleet has proved particularly vulnerable throughout the course of the war so far. According to Legion Magazine, a third of the fleet - in excess of 20 vessels - are believed to have been sunk either or disabled in the 27 months since the invasion began in February 2022.\"The most vulnerable turned out to be patrol boats and landing craft, indicating the high effectiveness of Ukrainian defense means,\" open source intelligence agency Molfar reported in March this year. \"The losses of large landing ships and frigates diminish the aggressor's capability to conduct large-scale maritime operations, having long-term strategic consequences for the Russian fleet.\"Earlier this year, Kremlin forces moved much of the fleet from its usual base in Sevastopol \"due to an increased risk of Ukrainian strikes\", the U.K Ministry of Defense observed in March. Novorossiysk port, in the north east of the Black Sea coast, \"now serves a crucial role in sheltering the Black Sea fleet's most valuable assets,\" the British government department said. Ukraine has vowed to reverse the Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula.In the May 19 update, Ukraine also said it had killed 1,210 Russian personnel on Saturday, May 18, as well as destroying \"16 tanks, 35 armored combat vehicles, 48 artillery systems, three anti-aircraft guns, two air defense systems, 47 operational-tactical UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles], one missile, 82 vehicles and two units of special equipment.\"Russia has not confirmed the loss of the ship, nor the number of casualties and other equipment losses reported by Ukraine.Newsweek has contacted the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment via email.",

One graphic by the Washington, D.C., think tank in its update on Sunday marked how Russian forces had advanced in central and northern Vovchansk, in Kharkiv region just over the Russian border.Kharkiv's deputy governor Roman Semenukha told Ukrainian television on Monday that despite Russian assaults, Kyiv's forces still control about 60 percent of the town.The ISW also said that Russian forces had advanced west and southwest of Donetsk City. Further south in Zaporizhzhia, offensive operations were continuing to clear Ukrainian forces from Robotyne.It comes as Ukraine awaits further military supplies from the West and amid anticipation over whether a $61 billion U.S. package passed by Congress can turn the tide in favor of Kyiv's forces, which have in recent months have had to conserve artillery and other resources on the battlefield.Meanwhile, a new mobilization law came into force on May 18 that Ukrainian lawmakers hope will replenish dwindling troop numbers in an attempt to stave off Russian forces, which have seized around 800 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory so far this year, compared with the 600 square kilometers gained in the whole of 2023.\"The stark military discrepancies between Ukraine and Russia are glaring,\" Leon Hartwell, senior associate at the London School of Economics think tank LSE IDEAS, told Newsweek. \"Traditionally, a three-to-one superiority is deemed necessary for successful offensive maneuvers, a threshold Ukraine currently lacks.\"\"Since last year, Ukraine has been outmatched by Russia by a factor of five-to-one in terms of artillery and seven-to-one in terms of drones,\" Hartwell said. \"The present circumstances may even be more unfavorable. Consequently, Ukraine finds itself predominantly on the defensive, but with weakened defensive capabilities.\"",

        "text": "Anne Rice's novel Interview With the Vampire has a rabid fan base, intensely protective of the story and any adaptations of it. Thankfully for Jacob Anderson, who plays Louis de Pointe du Lac in the AMC original series based on Rice's novel, the fans seem to be on board. \"I do get a sense that people feel like we did right by the characters.\" Now in its second season, this version, not connected to the 1994 film version starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, looks deeper into the \"mess\" of Louis. \"He's this jumble of contradictions...Louis is way more responsible for the tragedy of his own life than he would ever admit.\" For Anderson, he never once considered finding inspiration from the film. \"I think that would have been the first step to ruin it. To try and compare or do anything in response to that, because that film is iconic in its way and what it represents and those two very powerful screen presences at that particular time.\" He went on to say, \"Rolin [Jones, series creator] used to say this is a third thing. There's the book, the film and this is the third thing.\"SUBSCRIBE TO THE PARTING SHOT WITH H. ALAN SCOTT\nON APPLE PODCASTS OR SPOTIFYEditor's Note: This conversation has been edited and condensed for publication.This show has a rabid fan base. Do you get a sense of how intense their love of this show is?Oh, I don't think so. I do get a sense that that people feel like we did right by the characters. I'm sure there's people that feel like some of the deviations or differences between the source material and Anne Rice's writing, [they] might not like it. Like the essence of the characters, and the way that these stories feel when you read them is represented in the show. Anne Rice is very high emotion, heightened sense of feeling and how things feel and smell and taste. And hopefully you've got that in the show. And I do get that sense from people.What about this version of Interview with the Vampire originally appealed to you?Well, I didn't have a massive reference point to any other version in the beginning. So for me, I think I looked at it in quite a cynical way. At first I was like, \"Oh, it's another show based on a book that was made into a movie in the '90s.\" This was a period where there were a lot of those shows. So I looked at through this gaze. And then the script was just the most beautiful writing I've ever read. Like, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to say such beautiful words. And then I started to read Anne Rice and it kind of just built from there. Louis is such a mess. He's this jumble of contradictions and that is the most exciting thing you can do. That's the most exciting thing I think you could ever inhabit. Just a walking contradiction. Louis so embodies that.Considering Brad Pitt's portrayal of Louis in the film version is so well known, did the cultural influence of his portrayal impact your portrayal, and do you find fans compare yours with his?No, no, I mean, I haven't I haven't found that, I'm sure people are, I just haven't seen it. But I think that that would have been the first step to ruin it. To try and compare or do anything in response to that because that film is iconic in its way and what it represents and those two very like powerful screen presences at that particular time. I think that it would be a fool's errand to try and compete in some way. This should this feel like a different expression of the story, and this feels like its own thing. I remember Rolin [Jones, series creator] used to say this is a third thing. There's the book, the film, this is the third thing.One thing that does set this iteration of Interview with the Vampire apart from the film is how steamy it is, which does feel integral to the story. How important or vital is that to you to tell this story?I'm not sure, I think it's really important to the story and is really important to their relationship. I think that the way that sex plays out in relationships, it tells you a lot about the dynamics. I think power comes into that quite a lot. It's like, what is the power dynamic through the way sexuality plays out in relationship? And I think that actually almost represents this higher plane of feeling. Vampires can't really be separated from touch and from the exchange of bodily fluids, it sounds a little bit grim, but in terms of talking about blood and that closeness, like a vampire can't eat without physical contact. So it would be just be a little bit weird to not explore that. So I think it's less important to me and more that I don't really see how else you would portray this relationship. They're sexually attracted to each other. There's a sensuality to their relationship. Sex is a really important part of their dynamic.Where do we find Louis in season two?I'd say it's definitely darker. Using the term darker feels a bit like it's edgier, and it's not that. I think this season is quite a confronting at what happens when you really dig into your own culpability to things that that you felt you were the victim in or ways that you felt were wronged. And how much did you play a part in both fronts and responsibility you're really willing to take for your own actions and the way that you manifested your thoughts and feelings? Louis is way more powerful than he would ever admit, he is way more responsible for the tragedy of his own life than he would ever admit. And then Claudia (played by Bailey Bass) is stuck in, she's trapped in her body and she is so much more than others see her. She's stuck there, she can never really advance from that. And they're both outsiders in this very strange land and they are all wrong. These are very complex ideas. Rolin and writers are just like digging and picking at the scab. Season two is really picking the scab of these characters and the work they need to do on themselves.The first season felt like Louis was responding to the trauma of becoming a vampire, and in the second it feels like he's evolving into himself more. Do you feel that?Yeah. And a part of that is learning to, once you've accepted something, is learning to live with it. He's certainly not there yet, but I think that's his honesty, that's what he's trying to do, come to terms with a number of traumas. And I think this is a story about nature, about what is your nature, what is inherent in you and can you accept it? Can you truly accept who you are? And can you be lots of different things? Because I think Louis in many different ways. He's not just one thing. He's not just a vampire, he's not just a human. He's Louis.It's true. Unlike with Lestat (played by Sam Reid), who is layered but a lot of him is very transparent, but Louis is layered and he's revealing his layers this season.Yeah, I think Lestat is really layered. And I think it's really interesting, I've been talking about it quite a lot, we haven't met Lestat yet, an objective Lestat. But yeah, Louis is very conflicted. His life is beset with conflict and his family is a very confusing family and he grew up in New Orleans on the wrong side of Black Jim Crow South. He was a very complex human and continues to be a very complex vampire. But he's not comfortable with it. I think that's the big thing. He's not okay with it. Whereas Lestat embraces what he is. He enjoys it. He's found a way to really enjoy it and kind off gets off on how bad he is. Whereas Louis is really in denial about who he wants to be.That is another part of this portrayal of Louis that makes him different, touching on that dark part of the Jim Crow South. Did learning more about that part of history impact your portrayal?Louis grew up in New Orleans, but he grew up in this affluent Creole Black family who owned the plantation. It's a very ugly time in history and his family was on the wrong side of that. And because of that he couldn't fit in anywhere, and never fit in anywhere because of the circumstances he was born into. And he's chafing up against that all the time. He just wants to belong, kind of in the same way that Claudia just wants to belong. But I did think back to that quite a lot. About his upbringing and how he's perceived in New Orleans and the different hats he has to wear, because in 1940s Paris, there is this idea that Paris is this utopia, like racism doesn't exist. It's also like racism doesn't exist so long as you are exceptional in some way. You see him coming back from those spaces [salons], but he doesn't fit in there, either. And I think that's really interesting. He kind of never finds his place. But it always goes back to that.Another aspect of your performance in the aesthetics of Louis, the nails and the eyes. How much of that impacts your performance?It does a lot. In terms of Louis, it's changed a bit in season two, because he dresses down a little bit, he's dressing to blend in. Whereas in New Orleans, he's dressing to stand out, he wants to be the man, he wants to show how rich he is, wants to show how affluent he is. In Paris, he's trying to fit in, so he dresses down, which was a weird thing for me because I'm used to his physicality being a little bit more postured. And there was a bit less of that in Paris. But he's down. So that was helpful. For me, it was the lenses, just like having vampire vision. You can't see anything in low light. Everything has to be level otherwise you can't make out detail. You can't see the person in front of you. But I think that isolation is quite good, you sort of get this shut-in syndrome, every day is a period of time where all of the vampires in this show suddenly feel very aware of being trapped behind the eyes. Which I think gives you an otherworldliness that makes you feel alien.One thing I don't think a lot about people know about you is that you do music under the name Raleigh Ritchie. Do you have any new music coming out?I don't have any new music at the moment. I've got music coming out that will be new to anybody because we did a reissue of my first album. I think anybody can write a song. That's my feeling. And anything that I could do to democratize the idea of making something. So I was like, let's put some of the demos out that I was determined to keep them in a vault and never released. So at some point, this year, we'll put out some demos. So they'll be new songs to people, but not brand new.",

But Camilla has appeared to keep a respectful distance from her stepsons.The royal has not discussed the princes in any detail publicly. However, in 2018 she was asked on camera to reflect on the recent wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, which she had previously described as \"such a lovely day\" where \"everything went right.\"As Harry and Meghan celebrated their sixth anniversary on May 19, Newsweek looks at what Queen Camilla said about the couple's wedding day.In November 2018, the BBC broadcast Prince, Son and Heir: Charles at 70, a documentary celebrating Charles' 70th birthday, featuring exclusive interviews with his wife and sons.Camilla was asked about the royal wedding, which had taken place in May, and the moment her husband walked Meghan down the aisle.Harry told Charles, \"Thank you, Pa,\" after his father escorted Meghan to the high altar of St. George's Chapel. After rewatching the moment, Camilla said it was \"very touching.\"\"I think that was very touching,\" she said. \"Sitting where I was, you couldn't hear what he said, but afterwards, watching it on the television, I think it was a very ... it was a lovely gesture.\"Camilla also commented on the moment Charles was spotted offering his hand to Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, during the ceremony.\"A lot of people\u2014seeing my husband actually take the bride's mother by the hand to sign the registry, it's something that moved everybody,\" she said in the documentary. \"It's the things that he does behind the scenes that people don't know about. I don't think people realize quite how kind he is.\"Prior to her appearance in the documentary, Camilla referenced the wedding during a visit to Britain's Channel 5 network and its news team.\"It was such a lovely day,\" she told the journalists, per the Daily Mail. \"Just everything went right. We all wondered whatever would happen next, and then everything went right. The only thing is that we are all losing our voices now.\"She added: \"It's nice to have something that is uplifting rather than depressing. Everything was just perfect, including the weather, which couldn't have been better. It was a beautiful day.\"James Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London.

        "text": "Back to Black star Jack O'Connell says Amy Winehouse's ex-husband Blake Fielder is not the villain he's made out to be, blaming the media for the late singer-songwriter's tragic downfall.The British actor portrays Fielder\u2014formerly known as Blake Fielder-Civil\u2014in the biopic, which hit U.S. theaters on May 17. The film is named after Winehouse's 2006 album, which was inspired by her tumultuous on-again-off-again relationship with the former production assistant.Blamed for getting the Grammy winner hooked on heroin, Fielder was painted as a villain by the British tabloids and Winehouse's family as she publicly unraveled. However, O'Connell and director Sam Taylor-Johnson wanted to show a different side to the story in Back to Black.\"I think it's a very easy narrative to spin,\" the 33-year-old told Newsweek. \"Just to point to one baddie and boo him and just f****** tear him apart publicly.\"It felt like a good opportunity to discredit that portrayal, to question and interrogate it.\"Winehouse first met Fielder at a pub in London in 2005. That meeting is recreated in Back to Black, with the pair laughing, playing pool, and bonding over their shared love of 1960s tunes.Fielder-Civil had a girlfriend at the time, but it wasn't long before he and Winehouse (played by Marisa Abela) became a couple. However, their relationship was volatile.Winehouse suffered from bipolar disorder and bulimia, as well as battling substance abuse issues throughout her adult life, while Fielder found her fame hard to handle and longed for normality.Fans also held the now-42-year-old responsible for the star's spiraling addiction\u2014as did her father, Mitch Winehouse, portrayed by British actor Eddie Marsan in Back to Black. Fielder also faced allegations that he was only interested in Winehouse for her money.O'Connell didn't know what to make of Fielder before meeting him in person.\"I'd only really had what's out there to go off, you know, and it wasn't a fair [depiction],\" the Godless star said. \"I prepared to have my view altered, but I didn't expect to get on as well as we did. I felt like we had a lot in common.\"Fielder was arrested in 2008 for attempting to bribe a man he assaulted into dropping charges. He was sentenced to 27 months in prison.Like Fielder, O'Connell previously had trouble with the law. Born into a working-class family in Derby in the U.K., his father passed away when the Critics Choice Award nominee was just 18 years old. He struggled to cope with his father's death, and as a young man was in and out of court for violence and alcohol-related offences.While still at school, a teacher had encouraged O'Connell to try out for a television workshop. He was discovered by English director Shane Meadows, who cast him in the cult classic This Is England. The 2006 drama was a critical darling and launched O'Connell's career, although there was still a few years of couch-surfing and scraping by before he began getting offers from Hollywood.O'Connell and Fielder just \"hung out initially,\" while the actor tried to convince him that Black to Black wasn't a slam piece.\"I wanted for him to feel that I was approaching this in a non-judgmental way,\" O'Connell said. \"It was important to me, and he honestly spoke so earnestly and he was so genuine.\"Like, any time he spoke of Amy, his face lit up. He was talking about someone who he treasured and whose memory was very dear.\"Winehouse and Fielder eloped to Miami Beach, Florida, in 2007, surprising their families. The couple were hounded by the paparazzi throughout their relationship. Headlines included \"Amy on Crack\" and \"Amy's 5:00 am Cry for Help,\" accompanied by a photo of the star walking the streets in just her bra and jean shorts.Her phone was reportedly hacked by the British press, along with Fielder's, her brother Alex's and her parents' phones, while photographers would wait outside of rehab clinics to snap photos of Winehouse leaving.According to O'Connell, Fielder blames the British tabloids for Winehouse's mental and physical decline, describing celebrity coverage in the early 2000s as \"witch-hunt culture.\"\"Look at what they were subjected to,\" he said. \"If anyone here is the villain, it's the people pointing the cameras at them and constantly harassing them, encouraging their downfall for the want of newspaper sales.\"O'Connell believes the treatment of celebrities has improved since the height of Winehouse's fame. While social media has made 24/7 trolling a possibility, the Unbroken actor thinks people are more likely to call out the press for tormenting public figures.\"I think [Fielder's] experience is a marker between the perspective now and then,\" O'Connell explained. \"I don't think we tolerate that type of media so much anymore. With the internet you have the option to just not log on.\"\"They probably couldn't go to a f****** shop without being plastered on the front page [of a newspaper],\" he added. \"There's no defense when you've got gangs of crusty middle-aged men armed with cameras outside your front gate.\"Fielder filed for divorce from Winehouse from prison in 2008, citing adultery, which the musician confessed to. The divorce was finalized in 2009, but they rekindled their romance one more time before her passing in 2011.Winehouse continued to struggle with substance abuse following the split, leading to the cancellation of her 2011 European tour. She was found dead in her apartment a few weeks later, with her death attributed to alcohol poisoning. She was just 27 years old.Now sober and a father of two with his ex-partner Sarah Aspin, Fielder told Piers Morgan in 2018 that he would \"always carry a burden of guilt\" for Winehouse's death, but that \"Amy didn't do anything Amy didn't want to do.\"\"I feel I am the only person that's ever taken responsibility and has done since Amy was alive,\" he said, adding: \"[but] I've needed to stop carrying that cross on my own.\"When the first trailer for Back to Black dropped in January, social media users praised the \"perfect casting\" of O'Connell. Considering Fielder's reputation, some actors may take that as an insult, but O'Connell takes it as a \"compliment.\"\"I'm an optimist,\" he said.After portraying the highs and lows of the relationship that inspired the album Back to Black, does O'Connell have a different perspective on Winehouse's music than before?\"I think so,\" he said. \"But I think that can apply to any good music, great writing. It's timeless.\"I think her music will just get better and better [as time goes on], that is the measure of her type of genius.\"",

        "text": "Prince William will be an usher at one of the biggest society weddings of the year in Britain\u2014while Prince Harry will not attend.William and Harry are both friends with Hugh Grosvenor, 33, the Duke of Westminster, who is due to marry Olivia Henson, 31, at Chester Cathedral in Cheshire, northwestern England, on June 7. In fact, Harry is so close that the aristocrat is godfather to Prince Archie, the Duke of Sussex's 5-year-old son.However, Harry will not make Grosvenor's wedding to avoid the rift between the royal brothers overshadowing the special day, according to U.K. newspaper The Sunday Times.Guest lists can be awkward at any wedding, but for Grosvenor and Henson, they have the added pressure of high-profile media coverage as they tie the knot, whichever prince should show up.Ultimately, though, it would appear that the future king will be there, helping to welcome in guests at Chester Cathedral, and the second-born \"spare\" will miss the happy occasion.The reception will likely spare no expense as Grosvenor, according to The Sunday Times, has an inherited fortune of around \u00a310 billion [$12.7 billion].Many still question whether Harry and William will ever patch up their differences after the Duke of Sussex told Anderson Cooper during a 60 Minutes interview they no longer talk: \"Currently, no. But I look forward to us being able to find peace.\"Among the points of conflict is Harry's book Spare. In the memoir, the Duke of Sussex described William's \"familiar scowl, which had always been his default in dealings with me, his alarming baldness, more advanced than my own, his famous resemblance to Mummy which was fading with time, with age.\"Asked by Cooper whether the description was cutting, Harry said: \"I don't see it as cutting at all. My brother and I love each other. I love him deeply.\"There has been a lot of pain between the two of us, especially the last six years. None of anything that I've written, anything I've included is ever intended to hurt my family,\" the duke added.\"But it does give a full picture of the situation as we were growing up, and also squashes this idea that somehow my wife was the one that destroyed the relationship between these two brothers.\"Jack Royston is chief royal correspondent for Newsweek, based in London.

Now in the wake of Israel's recent invasion of Rafah, I am even more concerned.My lived experience highlights patients' profound challenges amidst ongoing conflict and resource scarcity. Weeks before the beginning of the continuing Israeli offensive into Rafah, I worked day and night at one of the few operational hospitals in Gaza, where overcrowded wards, dwindling medical supplies, and frequent power outages threatened human health.To assist, I was part of a collaborative effort between the World Health Organization (WHO) and several NGOs including my own, MedGlobal, to support health care delivery with additional staff.Amidst the suffering, the story of Rowan, a young woman battling a life-threatening infection, epitomized the struggle for survival in overwhelming adversity.Rowan was 20. Fifteen days before I arrived, she was run over in the night by a tank. Her family had\u202fmoved down from the north and set up a tent in what\u2014at the time\u2014was a designated safe area between Rafah and the sea.As the tent was crushed, most of the family passed between the tank's tracks and were unhurt, but Rowan was maimed. Her leg was broken and her pelvis cracked, but the major injury was to the soft tissue on her left side. When run over, the shearing forces often separate the skin and fatty tissues from the underlying muscle. Such injuries are easily infected.I met her during my first morning at the hospital. Her dressings were opened and a necrotizing or flesh-eating infection was apparent. This young adult needed major surgery to survive. I listened as the exhausted teams discussed who would take responsibility of this situation. What ended up being a limited procedure with some sedation was ultimately accepted. I expected her to be dead by the morning.By the next morning, I had made friends with a visiting surgical team from Jordan. Together we decided to take Rowan, still alive and talking, to the operating room. We removed layers of infected tissue for the next two hours, eventually covering it all in gauze with plans to reassess the wound the following day.With little breaks,\u202fI continued to operate. There was an old man crushed by a blown-up building who needed part of his stomach and intestine removed. There was a six-year-old girl with a shell fragment through the right side of her colon, whose abdomen I opened. But I kept thinking of Rowan.The next morning, she was improving. We again\u202fremoved more tissue and changed the less-pus-soaked dressings. The instruments we used, especially the scissors, were dull. I switched to scalpels. We thankfully had these tools, despite their general scarcity. With the years-long blockade of Gaza and the severe present restrictions on goods, every imaginable thing is rare.Haphazardly, it went utterly dark in the operating room. The power grid had been destroyed and the hospital's generator was glitchy. I started wearing a personal headlight during every surgery at all times of the day. Similarly, the precious fresh water supply to the operating room sinks occasionally stopped. When that happened, I scrubbed it with salt water.Each day I again operated on Rowan, but the initial gains against the infection slipped. I began to suspect she had been infected by\u202fPseudomonas\u2014a soil-living bacteria that makes thick films on wounds and has a particular smell. It can be hard to treat.A very basic strategy is using a weak chlorine solution known as Dakin's. The ingredients are simple and include baking soda and bleach, but a day's effort and dozens of conversations concluded that there was no bleach and probably no baking soda anywhere to be found.Her wounds refused to heal, even in the minimally infected areas around the hip and flank. Human bodies need an overabundance of nutrition, especially protein, to heal large wounds. Even now,\u202fGaza is starving. A tally of the food her family could provide was meager compared to the substantial need.One night, I was up late working on an old man with a lime-sized hole blown out the back of his chest by a bullet. He needed a flap of muscle to keep the air from sucking in and out of the hole. Afterward, I stopped by to see Rowan.In the dark room, she shared with many other patients on beds and mats, I climbed over sleeping bodies to the corner of the room where she stayed. I checked her\u2014already, the dressings were soaked. However, we lacked the operating room space to change her dressings more than once daily.For a while, I did not know how this story would end. The team of doctors was committed to helping Rowan through this injury. We eventually had high-level diplomatic support to move her to a burn center in Amman. The old man with the stomach injury died, and we were able to transfer Rowan to his ICU room, where we could do a dressing change in a genuine hospital bed twice a day.But her sepsis worsened despite high-quality debridement and she ran out of her considerable reserves. In the end, her wounds flowed with seepage\u2014there was too little protein in her starving body to hold the fluid inside. Doing what would be the final dressing change for this dying young woman\u2014I had a vision: the white of the dressing gauze was becoming the white of a funeral shroud.What was breathtakingly obvious to me was that for the many bombed, shot, and burned patients I cared for daily, the route back to health was profoundly impaired by deep deprivation. There was no bleach in Gaza to treat a woman's wounds. With Rafah's crossing no longer functioning, this deprivation will deepen.Judah Slavkovsky MD is a trauma and acute care surgeon.

        "text": "I held my breath as I watched my son Drew's black Honda pull away from the curb. I could see through the hatchback window a mound of colorful T-shirts balled up and intertwined with white sports socks and the swoosh of his favorite Nike sneakers pressed up against the bottom left corner. All his worldly goods rode along with him as my son drove away.I clutched my roiling, emotional stomach\u2014his first home. I felt my husband's arm pulling me closer, and I knew what he was thinking: \"How did we get here?\"Twenty-three years ago, he'd dubbed our son Dark & Stormy Drew, in recognition of the lightning and thunderstorm that raged outside the hospital window on the night he was born\u2014and for all of those festive cocktails we'd consumed in Bermuda, as newlyweds.\"It goes so fast,\" said the family and friends who'd streamed into our hospital room, peering into the isolette at the foot of my bed to see our newborn son, exclaiming at his little fingers and toes, alert marble eyes, and the wisps of soft brown hair that curled atop his head.A trite cliche, granted, but it was that same truth, the thief called time, which pierced me now.An only child until he was seven, Drew had been ecstatic about his little sister's arrival. Because Dayna was adopted, we'd been able to bring her home from the hospital when she was just one day old. Drew had been outside playing with the neighbor boys and came barreling over to the car when we arrived home from UCLA Santa Monica Hospital, the same place where he'd been born, and delivered by the same obstetrician.\"Keep everything as equal as you can,\" our social worker had instructed. She knew the challenges of what she referred to as a \"mixed family,\" one where a biological child and an adopted child are raised together.Drew took one look at his newborn sister and demanded \"Why is she so red?\" Then he laughed and ran back to his friends.Right before Dayna was born, the same social worker had told us not to be surprised\u2014but instead to be prepared for the day\u2014when our son would say something like \"I'm the real child\" to his sister, amidst a sibling power squabble.I dreaded it, but stored the possible zinger away with the school mom who, while admiring my infant daughter, looked at me quizzically and asked, \"But where is her real mom?\"Drew never did play the hurtful, \"real child\" card with Dayna. Maybe because she so seamlessly completed our family. My girl had fulfilled the prophecy of a dear, intuitive friend, who had said, in a flash of discernment, \"Your daughter is coming to you, but not through you.\"Maybe it was because Drew knew that one of the big reasons our birth mother had chosen us was because of him\u2014meaning she'd liked the idea of her child growing up with an older brother. Most likely, Drew hadn't tried to one-up his sister as she grew alongside him, because, as I knew and had observed, my son was both sensitive and kind.We three remained home and weathered the transition, growing accustomed to our \"new normal,\" welcoming Drew back to the fold during his summers off from college. Soon, four years had passed, and Drew was a college grad, flying home from Denver to move into his childhood room at our house in Los Angeles.\"It's just for a year, Mom,\" he'd warned. I couldn't have been more grateful to have this \"bonus\" year with my son. I was still working through the guilt I carried from when I suffered from depression and anxiety when I was convinced that I was a bad mother.Back then, when my husband had left for work and my children were safely in school, I would go into my son's bedroom, armed with a trash bag, and rummage through his things, looking for evidence that I was a Bad Mother.\nI always found it.There were clothes hanging in the closet that he'd outgrown. How could I have left them there, instead of gathering them up and giving them to the Salvation Army? Bad Mother!In the first drawer of his bureau, I'd found, tucked under his socks and boxer shorts, a porcelain statue of a little boy knelt in prayer, a pewter saint figurine, and a beaded bracelet rosary. Why had I not hung up the cross or put the mementos from Drew's first communion in a shadow box to hang on his wall, as my mother would have done? Bad Mother.Reaching into his desk drawer, I pulled out a camouflage-covered journal, the one I'd given Drew during the final year of his beloved summer day camp. I hesitated, knowing I shouldn't look inside. But I needed to know if he had heeded my advice to write down his thoughts. Inside, I found only one brief, inked entry, made more significant by the water, or perhaps a tear stain. Why hadn't I worked harder to pass on the tool of journaling to my son? Bad Mother!When I'd come out of the depression and back to myself, I'd taken my son to lunch, and broached the subject, wringing my hands under the table. He'd assured me that he always felt loved and taken care of. \"Mom, you're too hard on yourself,\" he'd said in response, which made us both laugh, as that was the admonition I'd consistently told him, growing up.Almost 18 months after delivering his one-year edict, Drew announced he was moving across the country, as he no longer wished to work remotely. My son's role with, and the company itself, was expanding, and he wanted to be there for it. The last week had gone by in a whirl of preparation and today my boy would start a 2,000-mile road trip to a new city where he'd begin a wholly independent life.Over our farewell morning coffee, I looked into his green eyes. Drinking in his familiar features, I realized I saw no vestige of either the boy, the teen, or the college student he'd once been.His face was more angular, and mature, and he held himself with the bearing of someone who was confident in himself and his convictions. A bowling ball-sized lump rose up in my throat and I felt tears prick my eyes, as I met this moment of the final letting go.Placing my coffee cup on the counter, I reached for his hand and squeezed it. I said nothing and smiled instead. My boy had become a man.Diana Daniele is a writer and literary publicist living in Los Angeles.

        "text": "In 2019, at the age of 31, I decided to undergo eye surgery. The reasoning behind this decision was quite personal. I was engaged, and struggling with contact lenses for my upcoming wedding, which was a few months away. It may seem like a small issue now, but at the time, it was significant.My mother and several friends had undergone laser eye surgery and recommended it as an option. I wanted to be free of the hassle of glasses or contacts on my wedding day. Being quite active and frequenting the gym, the idea of not having to wear glasses was appealing.I made an appointment to see if I was a candidate for the surgery. After a thorough evaluation, they confirmed that I was a perfect candidate. I spent roughly a month weighing the pros and cons before deciding to proceed.The surgeon assured me that the procedure was extremely safe, calling it one of the safest surgeries in the world. He spent a considerable amount of time convincing me of its safety, which was crucial as I was quite anxious.The surgeon highlighted that he had treated professional athletes who quickly returned to their sports after surgery. He did mention some potential downsides, like mild dry eye and the possibility of needing glasses again in the future, but the risk of corneal neuralgia was not discussed at all. Such potential risks were also not included on my consent form.On the day of the surgery, I was very anxious. The thought of something going inside my eye was daunting. My partner, who was incredibly supportive, accompanied me.Before the surgery, the medical team gave me Valium to help me stay calm. Initially, I was scheduled for LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis) but due to my anxiety, they switched to PRK (Photorefractive keratectomy) during the procedure because I couldn't keep the suction cup for LASIK steady due to my nerves.Reflecting on that day, I wish the medical team had recognized my anxiety and allowed me more time to reconsider. If they had, I might have opted out of the surgery. Informed consent is something I am now a strong advocate for, especially after my experience.After the surgery, which lasted about 15 minutes, I went home to rest. The next day, I began feeling a lot of pain and discomfort. At a follow-up appointment, I was told that the pain I was feeling was normal, and part of the immediate recovery phase. They assured me that I would be fine to return to work by Monday. However, the pain worsened over the week. This then lasted for months.I developed extreme light sensitivity, making it difficult to go outside or look at screens. This condition also lasted for several months. I was constantly in pain. During this time, my partner and I had to block out light from our home, and I wore dark sunglasses even indoors.The light sensitivity eventually improved, but the pain did not. I took a month off work, as I struggled to function normally. I reached out to the clinic multiple times, but their responses did little to alleviate my distress.I was prescribed a lot of pain medication, and my GP and other specialists worked hard to help me manage the pain.Despite their efforts, I still experience pain daily, even five years later. Some days are more manageable than others, but the unpredictability of the pain can make life challenging.As for legal action, I considered it but decided against it due to the potential costs. My interactions with the surgeon's team were uncomfortable, and I eventually cut off contact, requesting that any necessary information be communicated through my GP.I filed a formal complaint with the health department, which was still being investigated when the surgeon unfortunately passed away from COVID-19. This added a twist to my story, but the investigation led to changes in the clinic's policies regarding patient information on the risks of corneal neuralgia.Overall, this journey has been a roller coaster. I no longer share this story often, partly because of the surgeon's passing. However, I feel it's important for others to be fully informed before undergoing such procedures. My experience highlights the need for thorough communication and informed consent in healthcare.Erin Orchard is a 36-year-old student from Sydney, Australia, currently studying for my Master of Occupational Therapy.

They had been covered in ash since the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.I was the co-lead archaeologist on this dig. These recent discoveries\u2014the paintings of Helen and Paris, and Apollo and Cassandra, or of the blue sacrarium, soon to be published\u2014are a fresh stimulus for new studies in ancient art.Through my archaeological work at Pompeii, I have learned that history always moves by chance, and a small provincial town can improve the world's understanding of classical culture much more than many pages of ancient literature.In Pompeii, every object that is found speaks to us of a life suddenly and tragically cut short.Everything brings us back to an everyday dimension that had rhythms in some ways very similar to our own modern lives. When you find the remains of a person, it's like seeing yourself again, and what you're made of: Your bones, but also your fear of death and the hope of an afterlife.There is still about a third of the city to be discovered at Pompeii. We know its boundaries, we know how to trace its streets, and we have a fairly precise idea of the size of the blocks thanks to studies of ancient urban planning.The current cultural policy desired by Pompeii's director Gabriel Zuchtriegel is to disseminate new discoveries in real-time, and to provide the public with immediate and accessible in-depth tools through the E-Journal of the Pompeii Excavations.Therefore, everything that has recently been discovered has been promptly disseminated on media communication channels globally, and beyond, as before, to an audience of specialists.What is most important is that the unexcavated part of Pompeii represents the heritage that we will bequeath to future generations, who through this yet-to-be-explored part of the city will be able to relive the myth of Pompeii with skills and knowledge superior to ours in the present day.Dr. Alessandro Russo is an archaeologist at the Archaeological Park of Pompeii.\u200b***I am currently in charge of the archaeological laboratory of the excavation in Regio IX, 10, where the frescos were recently discovered. I take care of the materials that are recovered every day and that need to be viewed, cleaned, sorted, recorded, and stored.What I like about the work on the site is the possibility of working on the materials in direct contact with the context from which they come: Participating in their discovery, recovery and welcoming them into the laboratory where I am often asked to show them to the press or to illustrate them in the official communications of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii.During the excavation of a particular context, such as a block of the ancient city of Pompeii still buried by the eruption of 79 AD, you can find everything: From the structures of the buildings (even charred wooden elements, such as roof beams) to objects of everyday life, work tools, written testimonies (graffiti, drawings, stamps, inscriptions), the traces of what they ate (both charred food and garbage, even the residues of the contents of the amphorae), up to the remains of the victims (both humans and animals).In addition, in some cases, it is also possible to reconstruct presences from the voids found in solidified volcanic ash, by making plaster casts of the disappeared organic matter (furniture, doors and windows, trees, animals, and even people).It may seem strange, but my favorite personal discovery is the one you don't expect because it has already been made and, often, forgotten.I am referring to the many objects kept in the various deposits of Pompeii that have already seen the light of day at the hands of others, sometimes even for a few centuries, but which no scholar has ever dealt with again.It is like making an excavation within an excavation and, for example, after a basic search you can realize that in the usual repertoires, some ceramic forms have never been included.I'd like one day to find a written source where I can read that someone had left the city sometime before the eruption, perhaps taking their family with them.Something like a piece of graffiti engraved on the wall of the house before closing the door forever... In short, I would like to know and be able to imagine that someone, even unknowingly, managed to save themselves from that tragedy.Dr. Ausilia Trapani is an archaeologist collaborator at the Archaeological Park of Pompeii.All views expressed are the authors' own.Do you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

        "text": "My father lived a long life, much longer than he ever thought he would. A family history of heart disease and an early heart attack at 53 tempered his expectations.But he quit smoking, quit eating unhealthy fats, took long walks every day, and lived another 40 years.He was a private man and an anachronism in our Instagram culture. Born in Brooklyn in 1927, he grew up listening to radio programs, playing handball outside, and delivering Kosher meats on his bicycle for Mittman's.He never owned a cell phone, and only used the internet for email. He wasn't a fan of TV, though he did watch the Nationals and occasional NFL games\u2014usually with the sound off. One understood he didn't think much of the sports commentary.A mathematician who spent his career working for DC-area think tanks, my father really did prize thinking.As a little boy, I was mystified by his penchant for stillness and solitude. I'd watch him sitting alone on the screened-in porch on summer nights, his Camel cigarette glowing in the darkness. Sometimes, I'd step out and ask him what he was doing. \"Just thinking,\" he'd answer.Behind him, lights twinkled from the apartment high-rises in Friendship Heights, and the yard smelled of onion grass. This was around the time they were blasting for the Metro tunnel that would connect the Red Line from Friendship Heights to Bethesda. Explosions rumbled beneath the house, rattling the windows.Hard on himself, my father could be hard on the five of us too. When my siblings and I played too rough or got too loud, he'd scare the crap out of us with a few stern words.But he was most severe when it came to matters of learning. For him, learning was a moral obligation, the harder the better.When I was 14, he looked over my shabby grades and determined I had not \"learned how to learn.\" His misgivings about my abilities were always like this: Short, settled, and unimpeachable.That fall he took charge of my algebra studies. After dinner, propped against a stack of pillows, he'd sit upright in bed, smoking and reading the Washington Post. At the other end, I slogged through word problems on a long yellow legal pad and braced.My mistakes annoyed him. He corrected my work gruffly. He winced\u2014not even at me so much as at something outside my understanding. And my shame curdled into anger.When I didn't make the high school basketball team, he suggested I had unrealistic expectations, that I had overreached and that it fit a pattern.Maybe he thought this would sharpen my judgment. Instead, I began hooking school.Eventually, I dropped out altogether.My father wasn't a drunk, a deadbeat, a fraud, a wife-beater, or a crackpot. He took us to the National Zoo, to Arena Stage, and to museums to see Rodin statues and Gaugin paintings. He and my mother piled us into our Ford Galaxy station wagon for family vacations to the Rocky Mountains, Toronto, and Fenwick Island. He taught me how to ride a bike and how to drive a car. He bought me my first drum set and paid for years of private lessons at Charlie Byrd's Music in Spring Valley.He was a paradox: Reliable and present, but emotionally remote; devoted to his children but measuring out enough disapproval to sow self-doubt in me; steady and calm, unless our work ethic didn't meet his expectations; a brilliant thinker who couldn't find the words to validate my strengths; a rock-solid provider who might parse with qualifiers the credit you deserved for your accomplishments.In my twenties, as I struggled to right myself, my father acknowledged his criticisms had gone too far. He must've realized how badly I needed to hear this because the words were like chalk in his mouth.But as my father got older, something remarkable happened. He became more patient, more accepting, more generous.In 2003, when he was 76, he told me he was happy because the things he was afraid might happen didn't.\"Like what?\" I asked.\"That I would fail my children in some dreadful way\u2014though I undoubtedly failed them in some ways.\"He didn't try to explain why he'd been overcritical. Mostly, he was just relieved we'd all gotten through it. His children were good people with successful careers. That pleased him.As he grew less exacting and more forgiving, I wondered where this quality had been when I was 11 or 15 or 21 and needed it most.A few months before the pandemic, my father passed away. Afterwards, his wife, Ellen gave me several boxes of his belongings. (My mother and father split after I turned 18.)Some of the items I'd seen years earlier: His Ph.D. from Cornell; math journals where he published articles that looked like gibberish to me; old photos; report cards\u2014some mine, some my siblings'\u2014from long ago.One item stopped me cold: a deathbed apology his mother wrote him in 1953, a dozen years before I was born.Dear Dick,For all the things I've done that were wrong\u2014please forgive me, my son. Try to understand I didn't do them intentionally but because of the desperate life I led. Just as Nana and Grandpa didn't intend to injure their children\u2014yet they harmed us no end. Try to profit by what has happened and don't hurt your precious children.I want you to know too that even though you discarded me, I never stopped loving and admiring you. I hope you find peace and contentment and a well-balanced life.The end is drawing very near for me...I'm reluctant to die. I really wanted to get to know you again...I love you with all my heart.Your MomAbout his childhood, my father had never said much, even when I asked. The Depression wiped out his family's finances. At eight, he was already working, \"contributing to the family.\" His parents argued a lot.Beyond these details, he wasn't giving up much.\"I had to get out of there,\" he told me more than once. He did too, joining the Navy at 17 and serving in the Pacific during the last year of World War II.I always wondered what life had been like for him as a boy growing up in Crown Heights in the 1930s. Now I believe it was more troubled than he ever let on.Could his relationship with his mother hold the key to understanding why he and I spent years bumping heads? Was his capacity to fully nurture his own children sabotaged early in life by his mother? Were his tactical bursts of anger an echo of his mother's?His mother harmed him enough, evidently, that she was worried he would harm his children.Cast in this light, our struggles\u2014mine and his\u2014look different. I think now the more severe aspects of his personality reflected the turmoil of his upbringing, a thing he could not control.Maybe he mellowed with age. Maybe it was easier to tap into the language of encouragement after his kids were grown. Or maybe he didn't like the father he'd been and sought to fix it.Whatever the reason, late in life, he offered his approval more freely. He was still measured\u2014always that\u2014but during his late 60s and on into his 70s and 80s, he took pride in my successes, he admired my work teaching high school in Baltimore, he thought highly of my friendships, he appreciated hearing my thoughts on books.Gone were the bitter arguments of our past. In their place, faith seeped in\u2014and with it, love, unobstructed at last.Adam Schwartz's debut collection of stories, \"The Rest of the World,\" won the Washington Writers' Publishing House 2020 prize for fiction. His non-fiction has appeared in the Baltimore Sun, Baltimore Banner, Forward, New York Daily News, Sewanee Review, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Washington Independent Review of Books, and other publications.

        "text": "A man has made an incredible discovery on a beach in South Carolina after he found a prehistoric fossil tooth.Kyle Finley, a regular visitor to Edisto Beach, South Carolina, stumbled upon a rare American mastodon tooth fossil during a casual evening stroll. \"I was walking along the shoreline watching the sunset, not really looking for fossils or anything,\" Finley told Newsweek.\"At one point, I happened to look down and I saw the six spikes poking out of the sand. I immediately thought it looked like it could be a mastodon tooth,\" Finley said. \"I started to uncover it and realized that it was indeed a mastodon tooth. I couldn't believe it and I was in complete shock. I never thought I'd find a complete one, much less such a beautiful one. Definitely a once-in-a-lifetime type of find.\"Finley has been visiting Edisto Beach with his family since he was young. Fossil hunting has always been one of his favorite beach activities, but he couldn't believe it when he found the well-intact tooth.A spokesperson from the Natural History Museum in London looked at the images and confirmed the significance of Finley's find, positively identifying it as a molar tooth of an American mastodon, or Mammut americanum.The American mastodon is a distant cousin of mammoths and elephants. The creature roamed North America during the late Miocene through late Pleistocene epochs, becoming extinct around 10,000 years ago.American mastodons were slightly shorter and stockier than mammoths, with females standing at around 7 feet tall and males up to 10 feet tall.In fact, Edisto Beach in South Carolina is well-known for its abundance of fossils, with many people reporting finding items including shark teeth\u2014such as those from the extinct megalodon\u2014and fossils of mammals like the American mastodon.\"I've seen pictures of mastodon teeth in books and museums, and I've always thought it was the coolest-looking fossil. I definitely plan on keeping it,\" Finley said. \"I will probably take it to a museum or university to get some more information on it and get advice on how to properly preserve and store it.\"Last year, a woman found an incredible 12 million-year-old megalodon tooth while on the beach in Venice, Florida.Earlier this year, paleontologists uncovered the fossil of a brand-new species of ancient snake. Thought to have lived around 47 million years ago, the giant creature, Vasuki indicus, measured between 36 and 50 feet long.",

        "text": "For many people, Sundays are the perfect opportunity for a lazy day spent in front of the TV. As it turns out, the same applies to dogs as well, because one golden retriever loves nothing more than watching his favorite shows from the comfort of the sofa.Pet owner Kyla Satterfield has delighted the internet after sharing a video of her dog, Kenna, spending her Sunday afternoon in the best possible way; watching cooking shows. The pup was trying so hard to focus on the screen, but when her owner interrupted her concentration, she slowly turned her gaze away from the television and stared at Satterfield.Since the clip was shared on May 5, it has amused many TikTok users, with over 2.2 million views and more than 285,000 likes already, much to Satterfield's astonishment. Sometimes, all you need is a sofa day, and Kenna certainly requires that after a busy week of napping and playing.Satterfield told Newsweek: \"The reaction from the video has been exciting and full of hilarious comments. I'm so glad the video of our precious Kenna has put a smile on so many faces already.\"There is no doubt that the golden retriever has got her Sunday afternoon routine down to perfection, but it may not specifically be the cooking techniques and advice that catches her eye. Experts at PetMD say dogs can be captivated by the motion, visuals, or the sounds coming from the television screen.The way that dogs see things is very different to humans; their vision isn't as sharp, and they only have two color-processing cells in their retinas, compared to the three that we have. They can see blues, greens, and yellows, but any other colors will seem very dull to them.Most dogs probably aren't watching cooking shows, however. PetMD says that they will typically be interested in things that attract them in real life, too. If your pet loves chasing squirrels outside, they might want to watch a nature show all about those pesky creatures.However, each to their own, and let's just hope that Kenna realizes that the food being prepared on screen won't magically appear in front of her, too.The video of Kenna relaxing after a tough week has delighted many people online who could relate to her desire to put her paws up and just unwind in front of the TV. The caption alongside the clip reads: \"On Sundays we watch cooking shows!\"Kenna has certainly earned praise online, and since going viral, the post has received more than 2,100 comments. One comment reads: \"In her previous life her name was Barb and she loved all the cooking shows.\"Another TikTok user wrote: \"Shhhh. She's planning out her meals for the week.\"A third person commented: \"She's trying to help you with dinner ideas.\"Do you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?

Fisher looks after Mylo full-time, so they are rarely apart. However, there is the occasional moment where she has to step away to deal with something around the house.Though it might not always make things easy for moms and dads, that bond between parent and child is crucial. A 2023 study published in Frontiers in Psychology found the more time parents spend with children, the higher their child's well-being was likely to be.Fortunately, in Fisher's case, her son has come up with an adorable stop-gap for those situations, as she discovered to her delight recently. In a video posted to TikTok last week under the username @alicefisher26, the busy mom captured the moment Mylo began cuddling up with the robe she left on the bed.Fisher told Newsweek her son is \"very attached\" to her and they share \"a very close bond.\"\"He likes to keep my robe close to him to smell my scent,\" she added. \"I thought it was a cute video of him to share and didn't expect so many views and comments.\"At the time of writing, the video has been watched over 2.9 million times on TikTok.\"You're his whole world to him,\" one TikTok user commented. \"I can truthfully say being a mother is the greatest gift of them all. It's not easy but their snuggles and smiles make up for it.\"Another user shared a similarly adorable story and wrote, \"When my son was 3 months old he was inconsolable. I was sitting in the hospital with my mom. My husband gave my baby a shirt I wore that day. My baby played with it for 20 minutes. And then he fell asleep.\"A third posted: \"When I was little I used to go and snuggle my mum's dressing gown when I was upset or scared and she was at work. I'd forgotten about that.\"Commenting on the video's popularity, Fisher agreed: \"There are a lot of comments from people saying they did the same as a child and lots of people who also have to leave their kids to go to work and also because Mylo's is super cute.\"Fisher said that while day-to-day love and affection is crucial, having things like robes can help prepare kids for when they get older.\"I think it's really important to cuddle and show affection to our babies as much as possible,\" she added. \"But giving a comforter like my robe is a great way for babies to self soothe and be able to be a little bit more independent as you can see Mylo is playing in the video because he has the comfort of my robe.\"Do you have funny and adorable videos or pictures you want to share?

And while it did appear to lather at first, it then soaked into the skin, with James saying: \"This is why I just thought it was really bad moisturizer.\"James' admission has led to hundreds of people revealing they have made the exact same mistake, as her newest video was in response to a woman who said: \"The way I RAN to my bedside table to discover my moisturizer is actually body wash.\"\"Same thing happened to me til my husband used it, his beard was a bit wet and it started to foam up,\" another user said, adding that both she and her mother had been using it as moisturizer \"for weeks\".Another said: \"I've made this mistake too haha I did realize sooner but I still fell for it! Have since found the actual dove moisturizer haha.\"Speaking to Newsweek, business owner James said she felt \"very silly\" when she finally figured out she had been using the wrong product for a year.\"I went and stayed at a friend's house in Adelaide and she had the body wash in the shower, I thought, 'Oh that looks like my moisturizer,'\" she said. \"Then when I came home and used it the penny dropped because I realized the consistency was lathering up not rubbing in!\"Asked if the body wash worked as a moisturizer, James admitted that it had not.\"I had been complaining to my mum only a week earlier that my skin was dry no matter how much lotion I use,\" she said, adding: \"Makes sense now!\"One good thing to come from James' public admission to using the completely wrong product for a year is that she now feels \"vindicated\" upon learning that she was not alone.\"I don't think anyone managed to make the mistake as long as me, but the fact there are hundreds of people out there doing the same thing makes me feel not as dumb!\"She added that the word \"moisturizer\" is in large writing on the bottle, while \"body wash\" is written in small writing, so it \"makes sense everyone else has done it\".Dove is one of the most popular beauty brands in the world, and in 2023 was valued at approximately 6.5 billion dollars.In 2021, Dove was among the top three health and beauty brands worldwide, \"with over two billion consumer reach points,\" Statista wrote.James said she hasn't heard anything from Dove despite her videos going so viral for some \"free viral publicity,\" as \"everyone obviously loves the products, we are just using it wrong.\"She added however: \"Their packaging needs an overhaul for people like me who don't read fine print.\"Newsweek has contacted Dove for comment.Do you have funny and adorable videos or pictures you want to share?

        "text": "As the electric vehicle industry grows at a record-breaking pace, Kia is leading the charge with its battery-powered line-up. In particular, the new EV9 has turned heads as one of the first electric, three-row SUVs to hit the mainstream market. And in less than a year, the model has collected over a dozen national and global awards \u2013 and counting.Company Awards and RecognitionAt Newsweek's 2024 Auto Disruptor Awards, the Research and Development Disruptor of the Year title went to Kia's EV9 for its outstanding example of auto innovation. Newsweek also awarded Designer Disruptor of the Year to Karim Habib, Head of Kia Global Design, highlighting his leadership of the brand's Opposites United design philosophy that melds inspirations from nature and humanity.\"At Kia Design, an innovative and forward-thinking mindset is a necessary intrinsic quality, essential for providing relevant and meaningful products and experiences,\" said Habib at the Newsweek event.Kia has also received accolades from the World Car Awards, where the EV9 won 2024 World Car of the Year\u2122* and 2024 World Electric Vehicle\u2122*. Only two months prior, the North American Car of the Year jury awarded the EV9 with the title of North American Utility Vehicle of the Year\u2122*. These titles, plus several other awards, solidify Kia as a force to be reckoned with in the electric vehicle space.Research and DevelopmentCentral to Kia's success is its R&D process, which is setting new standards for Kia and its competitors. According to Sang Lee, National Manager of Product Planning at Kia North America, the EV9 falls under Plan S, Kia's initiative to spearhead electric vehicle innovation. Through Plan S, Kia expects to offer up to 15 models globally by 2027, and is targeting 1.6 million EV world-wide sales in 2030With the enormous success of Kia's latest electric vehicles, the company is well on its way to achieving its goals. \"These high targets apply to all aspects of the vehicle, including, but not limited to, performance, quality, safety and technology,\" said Lee.One of the most attention-grabbing aspects of the EV9 is its aerodynamic capability. The car's drag coefficient, which measures how easily a vehicle moves through air, is an impressive 0.28, exceeding competitors like the 2023 Jaguar I-PACE and the 2023 Lamborghini Huracan. This level of drag reduction is nearly unheard of among vehicles with an upright, SUV design like the EV9. For Kia's R&D team, hitting that milestone involved a new focus on optimizing airflow underneath the vehicle through a process called \"3D undercover.\"The R&D team also took major steps forward in vehicle charging and design. The EV9's 800-volt architecture can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in under 25 minutes2 \u2013 far less time than most three-row electric SUVs in the current market. And the Star Map technology that powers the taillamps and daytime running lamps advances lighting design by taking visual influences from the night sky.\"Even the HVAC system in the EV9 embodies the future,\" said Lee. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning in the front of the car can operate separately from the rear, and settings like After Blow help reduce condensation from air conditioning.Lee explained that these developments are just the beginning. \"Innovation is baked into every aspect of the EV9,\" he said.Features, Safety and DesignOther design innovations of Kia's new electric SUV include an available extendable center console in the SUV's second row and over-the-air3services that help customers update the car's software system.Grounding these improvements is a steadfast commitment to innovation, which Lee says motivated the design process. Using some of Kia's most sophisticated Advanced Driver Assistance System4 technologies, the EV9 includes new features like available Remote Smart Parking Assist 25. This tool is designed to allow drivers to navigate parallel, perpendicular and diagonal parking with the click of a button, even from outside the car. The inclusion of ten total airbags6 including a Front Center Side Airbag, also ensures added security for all passengers in the vehicle.Kia's R&D team made certain that EV9 consumers would enjoy top-of-the-line comfort. The driver's seat is available with Ergo Motion, which provides a massage function in the backrest and cushion, while the first and second rows are equipped with available \"relaxation seats7,\" allowing occupants to lean farther back when the vehicle is parked. \"Imagine pulling up to a charging station and taking a nap!\" Lee said.The EV9 also comes with more total legroom than some competitors like the 2024 Audi Q8 e-Tron, 2024 BMW iX and 2024 Cadillac Lyriq. Although the EV9 has smaller dimensions overall than the Rivian R1S, it makes the most of its space, providing more third-row headroom and shoulder room8. Notably, the EV9's braking abilities9, cornering performance10 and interior quietness11 exceed electric SUVs that sell for well over $100 thousand \u2013 close to double the cost of an EV9.* For more award information, visit https://www.worldcarawards.com.2 Charge time based on Kia Corporation testing with 800v DC fast charger and approximately 72 degrees Fahrenheit battery temperature.

        "text": "Taylor Swift could convince President Joe Biden's supporters to vote Republican in November, exclusive Newsweek polling shows.Twenty-two percent of voters who backed Biden in the 2020 election say they would be more likely to vote for a GOP candidate in an election if Swift endorsed them, a May poll conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies for Newsweek found.The survey, which was conducted among 1,500 eligible voters on May 1, shows a nine-point increase from January, when only 13 percent of Biden 2020 supporters said they would be more like to vote for a Republican candidate backed by Swift.The singer-songwriter's influence seems to be growing among Trump supporters as well, albeit less so then among Biden supporters. In January, 13 percent of Trump 2020 voters said they'd be more likely to vote for a Democrat candidate endorsed by Swift. That number only rose to 16 percent this month.Both the May and January polls had a margin of error of +/-2.53 percent. The January survey was conducted among 1,500 eligible voters on January 18.Swift's fame has been stratospheric and her celebrity status has only skyrocketed over the last year. She was named Time magazine's 2023 \"Person of the Year\" and her wildly popular Eras tour became the first tour to cross the billion-dollar mark. Her popularity has raised questions about whether a Swift endorsement could sway the 2024 election.\"She's influenced popular culture, sports, the economics of entire regions of the U.S.,\" communications consultant James Haggerty previously told Newsweek. \"So why not politics and elections?\"The May poll found that overall, 18 percent of Americans would be more likely to vote for a Swift-backed candidate. In comparison, 15 percent would be less likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by the pop sensation and 55 percent say her views wouldn't influence their vote.The survey found that Swift would have more influence over male voters and younger voters. Twenty-seven percent of male voters say they'd be more likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by Swift, compared to just 11 percent of female voters. A third of voters aged 18 to 24 also said they'd be more likely to vote for a candidate if Swift backed them, compared to 14 percent of those 65 years of age and older.Although she's largely stayed out of politics, Swift supported the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020 and did make critical comments about former President Donald Trump during the last presidential election cycle.Swift also endorsed two Democratic candidates for Congress in Tennessee in 2018 as part of her opposition to Republican Marsha Blackburn's Senate campaign. Blackburn went on to win her race, defeating Swift-backed Phil Bredesen with more than 54 percent of the vote. Swift's other candidate, Jim Cooper, won his House race.",

        "text": "China is retaliating over anti-dumping measures taken by the U.S. and European Union amid concern that heavily subsidized Chinese products are threatening national industries.The country's Ministry of Commerce on Sunday announced an anti-dumping investigation into POM (polyoxyethylene) copolymers produced in the U.S., the EU, Japan and Taiwan after receiving an application \"on behalf of\" Chinese producers of the plastics.The news comes as the trade war between the world's largest and second-largest economies enters its seventh year amid rising anxiety across the EU, where Chinese producers of electric vehicles (EVs) and other goods have secured commanding market shares in recent years.\"The Ministry of Commerce has decided to conduct an anti-dumping investigation on imported acetal copolymers originating in the European Union, the United States, Taiwan and Japan,\" the ministry said in a statement.POM copolymers, also known as acetal copolymers, are durable and resistant to wear and chemicals, making them ideal for automotive parts, industrial machinery and electrical components.Under China's anti-dumping regulations, these investigations can involve \"interested parties\" filling out questionnaires, hearings, samplings, and on-site inspections, the statement said. Such probes typically conclude within a year, but can take up to 18 months, the ministry said.This move follows President Joe Biden's decision last week to maintain Trump administration tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports while hiking tariffs on categories totaling $18 billion in value.Biden, who in 2022 signed legislation allocated over $70 billion and $10 billion to the American EV and solar industries, respectively, cited a need to protect American workers.\"For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies across a whole range of industries: steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, solar panels\u2014the industries of the future,\" Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. \"We're not going to let China flood our market.\"The Chinese government has been estimated to spend more than twice as much on industrial subsidies as the U.S., giving companies an unfair advantage.Tariffs on Chinese EVs, which have a negligible market share in the U.S., have quadrupled from 25 percent to 100 percent, while those on solar cells were raised from 25 percent to 50 percent. Other targeted products include major Chinese exports such as steel, aluminum, semiconductors, lithium-ion batteries and rare earth minerals.China is now the dominant force in green tech, estimated to control some 80 percent of the solar panel supply chain alone. Chinese EV exports soared from 4.2 percent of the global total to 35 percent last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.The Chinese commerce ministry stated that the sanctions violated Biden's pledge \"not to seek to suppress and contain China's development\" and vowed \"resolute measures to defend its rights and interests.\"Peter Sattler, senior lecturer in economics at Duke Kunshan University, told Newsweek that these tariffs are the wrong approach from the perspective of U.S. consumers.\"The fear of an even bigger China Shock in the auto industry during this transition might be driving these tariffs,\" he said, speculating they could be due to \"political considerations of keeping the rust belt states of Michigan and Wisconsin in the blue camp.\"The \"China Shock\" refers to the rapid influx of Chinese goods following the country's admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001.Sattler said Chinese products have been a net positive for the U.S. economy. \"Competing with the best firms in the world keeps U.S. companies competitive and innovative, and that competition also serves the interest of U.S. consumers.\"Last week, the EU announced a probe into Chinese tinplate steel. The 27-member trade bloc has already launched investigations into Chinese EVs, solar panels, medical devices and wind turbines.Newsweek reached out to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the European Commission via written requests for comment.China's relations with Japan are strained over a number of issues, from their territorial dispute in the East China Sea to Japan's military buildup to counter China's increasingly assertive posture in the region.China's ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which it views as its territory, are set to be tested further following Monday's inauguration of Taiwan President Lai Ching-te of the Beijing-wary Democratic Progressive Party.",

        "text": "The complex ties between Iran and Azerbaijan have been thrust into the spotlight after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi died alongside members of his entourage in a helicopter crash following a trip to the border between the two nations.Raisi had attended a ceremony overseeing the opening of the Qiz Qalasi Dam with his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev on Sunday before boarding the U.S.-made Bell 212 helicopter to the Iranian city of Tabriz in the Iranian province of East Azerbaijan in the midst of heavy fog conditions. Accompanying him on the return trip was Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, East Azerbaijan Governor General Malek Rahmati, Tabriz Friday prayers leader Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Ale-Hashem and an unspecified number of guards and crew members.Aliyev was among the first foreign leaders to express his concerns upon news that contact was lost with the helicopter carrying Raisi somewhere over East Azerbaijan province. He offered prayers and stated, \"As a neighbor, friend, and brotherly country, the Republic of Azerbaijan stands ready to offer any assistance needed.\"A massive search and rescue effort commenced, with support from abroad, including Turkey and the European Union, and after the site of the crash was located, Raisi and all those on board the helicopter were declared dead.Aliyev then reached out directly on Monday to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling the event a \"tragic loss\" in which \"the Iranian people lost a prominent statesman who served his country with dedication and loyalty all his life.\"\"On this day of sorrow, I pray to Allah Almighty to grant patience and fortitude to the friendly and brotherly people of Iran,\" Aliyev said. \"We share in your grief and on behalf of myself and the people of Azerbaijan, I extend our deepest condolences to you, the families and loved ones of those who perished, and to your entire nation.\"Condolences were also offered to Iranian counterparts from Azerbaijan's foreign minister, defense minister, the speaker of Parliament and other top officials in Baku.Ties between the fellow majority-Shiite Muslim nations have fluctuated over the years, though relations had most recently been on the upswing at the time of Raisi's death.\"Despite all ups and downs for at least the last three years, thanks to political will of our leaders, and strategic vision, Azerbaijan-Iran relations are back to normal,\" Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Aykhan Hajizada told Newsweek. \"The meeting of May 19 between the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Iran, the commissioning and inauguration of important projects on the border was one of the important chapters in the history of Iran-Azerbaijan relations.\"\"We were deeply shocked by the tragic demise of [the] president, foreign minister and other officials of Iran as a result of a helicopter crash following the mentioned meeting. We mourn these heartbreaking deaths, a tragic loss beyond words,\" Hajizada added.\"At the same time, despite tragic events and disturbances, we believe it is important to take Azerbaijan-Iran relations forward, and Azerbaijan is ready to work with current and future Iranian leadership to that end.\"Hajizada further noted that \"Azerbaijan-Iran relations have historic roots, and these relations are an important condition for [the] well-being of our nations and for stability in our region.\"Newsweek reached out to the Iranian Embassy to Azerbaijan and the Iranian Mission to the United Nations for comment.Despite recent improvements, however, a degree of mistrust has lingered between Baku and Tehran on certain issues.Among the prevailing grievances from the Islamic Republic has been Azerbaijan's decision to boost ties with Iran's top foe, Israel, in recent years. Some Iranian experts and commentators have gone as far as to reference concerns over a \"second Israel\" being established in the South Caucasus.While tensions have risen substantially between Iran and Israel since the war in Gaza erupted last October, Aliyev only further boosted cooperation with the administration of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meeting Israeli President Isaac Herzog on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in February.The Israeli government did not immediately issue any official reaction to Raisi's death, though far-right Parliament member Avigdor Lieberman, head of the Yisrael Beytenu party, referred to Raisi as a \"brutal man\" and said \"we won't shed a tear\" over his death.United States-Iran frictions have also intensified over the course of the conflict in Gaza, but U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller offered the country's condolences over the incident while reaffirming \"our support for the Iranian people and their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\"Other concerns in Iran regarding Azerbaijan have been directed toward suspected ties between Baku and Azeri separatist movements in northwestern Iran. Iran is home to a sizable minority of ethnic Azeris, numbering up to a quarter of the population by some estimates and majorities in the regions bordering Azerbaijan.Majad Javadi Araz, a spokesperson for the separatist Azerbaijan National Resistance Organization, mocked the search and rescue effort for Raisi on Monday, noting that it was a Turkish drone that appeared to first locate the site of the helicopter crash. Araz also observed how Aliyev sought to link together \"the two coasts of Aras,\" the river that divides Iran and Azerbaijan where the two leaders met Sunday to inaugurate the new dam prior to Raisi's death.Meanwhile, Azerbaijani authorities have cracked down on pro-Iran elements in their own country, particularly those tied to the \"Islamic Resistance in Azerbaijan,\" also known as the \"Huseyniyun,\" a self-proclaimed part of the broader \"Axis of Resistance\" coalition aligned with Iran. As Iran and Israel exchanged a direct series of attacks last month, Axis of Resistance factions reported on the death of a Huseyniyun official in Azerbaijani prison.The Huseyniyun-affiliated Azerbaijan Studies Center also closely followed the news of Raisi's helicopter crash and accused alleged Israel-affiliated actors of seeking to create instability in the event that the Iranian president was declared dead. Following confirmation of his demise, the Huseyniyun issued a statement Monday congratulating Khamenei for the \"martyrdom\" of Raisi and his companions.Other complaints from Baku stem from accusations that Iran supported Armenian and allied separatist forces in recent conflicts over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.But Iran and Azerbaijan do share a number of common interests, particularly the development of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INTSC), an ambitious rail project that seeks to connect India to Russia by way of Iran and Azerbaijan. With tensions still simmering over the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and just days after war erupted between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Iran signed a historic agreement last October to establish the Aras corridor to allow Azerbaijan access via Iranian territory to the exclave province of Nakhchivan.The route would provide an alternative to the more controversial Zangezur corridor plan, which would cut through Armenia and potentially lead to further conflict and instability in the South Caucasus. The Aras corridor agreement marked a positive shift in ties between Tehran and Baku, which were further boosted during Amir-Abdollahian's follow-up visit to Azerbaijan in March.Raisi's border visit was viewed as yet another affirmation of warming relations between the two countries, during which Aliyev declared \"there will be many more meetings in the future\" just hours before Raisi's death would overshadow the trip.Prior to the confirmation of Raisi's death, Khamenei had vowed continuity in Iran's governance and has since named First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber as acting president per Article 131 of the Iranian Constitution, while nuclear negotiations chief Ali Bagheri was named acting foreign minister. New elections are set to be held within 50 days.",

But by Monday, 227,715 customers were still without power, with the company warning that some would not have power until the end of the day on Wednesday.The outages were so widespread that even the company's own online outage tracker was overwhelmed and stopped working reliably.This all comes amid a heatwave in the state, with temperatures climbing to around 90 F, which officials have warned is \"driving increased electric use.\"\"We understand the higher temperatures we are experiencing across Houston and surrounding communities make getting the lights and air conditioning back on even more important,\" Lynnae Wilson, CenterPoint's senior vice president of electric business, said in a statement.On Sunday, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas asked Texans to reduce their energy use by \"turning up your thermostat a degree or two, if comfortable, and postponing running major appliances or pool pumps\" between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. local time on Monday.High temperatures are expected to linger, with heat indexes likely approaching 100 F by midweek, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Marc Chenard.\"We expect the impact of the heat to gradually increase ... we will start to see that heat risk increase Tuesday into Wednesday through Friday,\" Chenard said.Read more: Compare Top Health Savings AccountsThe Houston Health Department said it would distribute 400 free portable air conditioners to seniors, people with disabilities and caregivers of children with disabilities in the area to contend with the heat.Five cooling centers have also been opened\u2014four in Houston and one in Kingwood.The heatwave follows a week of severe weather warnings for Texas.On Tuesday, more than 15 million people from Texas to Florida were under threat of severe storms and tornadoes, according to the Storm Prediction Center.The National Weather Service said a tornado briefly touched down near the Cypress area in Texas on Thursday while another tornado struck the southwest portion of Waller County.The dangerous weather conditions prompted President Joe Biden to issue an expedited major disaster declaration for seven counties across Texas, allowing FEMA to quickly approve individual assistance in addition to Small Business Administration low-interest loans.Houston Mayor John Whitmire and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said on Friday that the recovery process would likely take weeks, not days.\"It was fierce. It was intense. It was quick, and most Houstonians didn't have time to place themselves out of harm's way,\" Whitmire said at a news conference.",

        "text": "Saudi Arabia hosted its first swimsuit fashion show on Friday, marking a notable cultural shift in a country where women were required to wear body-covering abaya robes just a few years ago.Most models showed off swimsuits that exposed their shoulders, some had partially exposed midriffs, and others featured plunging necklines with body-hugging silhouettes \u2014 styles that would be unthinkable to show off in public a few years ago.The poolside event took place on the second day of the inaugural Red Sea Fashion Week at the St. Regis Red Sea Resort.The show's main showcase was Moroccan designer Yasmina Qanzal's collection, featuring simple swimwear that ranged from one-pieces with deep V-cuts and off-shoulder motifs to bandeau tops and various sarongs.\"It's true that this country is very conservative but we tried to show elegant swimsuits which represent the Arab world,\" Qanzal told the AFP news agency. \"When we came here, we understood that a swimsuit fashion show in Saudi Arabia is a historic moment, as it's the first time such an event is being held.\"The fashion week is part of Red Sea Global, one of the mega-projects central to Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 social and economic reform program, overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The fashion industry in Saudi Arabia has been growing rapidly. In 2022, the industry contributed $12.5 billion, or 1.4% of the national GDP, and employed 230,000 people, according to a recent report by the Saudi Fashion Commission. That growth aligns with the broader goals of Vision 2030, aiming to establish Saudi Arabia as a global hub for fashion and culture.Since being named crown prince in 2017, bin Salman has spearheaded several initiatives to modernize Saudi society, including the sidelining of the country's religious police, reintroducing movie theaters and organizing mixed-gender music festivals.All of these reforms, taken together, are part of bin Salman's long-term project of reducing the kingdom's dependence on oil by diversifying its economy and promoting sectors from tech to tourism, sports, entertainment and fashion.The plan includes numerous social reforms designed to liberalize some of the kingdom's stringent cultural norms, as well as several massive infrastructure projects currently in development that, if completed, would turn Saudi Arabia into a major destination for foreign capital.While bin Salman is leaning into his reputation as a reformer, he remains an autocratic leader. U.S. intelligence agencies believe he personally gave the order to kill American journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018, a horrific incident that put renewed strain on the U.S.-Riyadh relationship.",

        "text": "Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, is doing better than expected under cross examination, a former federal prosecutor has said.Neama Rahmani was reacting to Michael Cohen's third day of cross-examination on Monday in Trump's hush money trial.On Monday, Cohen admitted that he had lied to reporters about Trump's alleged affair with former adult film star Stormy Daniels, and also admitted that he stole from Trump's parent company, the Trump Organization.Rahmani, now president of the West Coast Trial Lawyers law firm in Los Angeles, told Newsweek that Cohen was \"taking a beating on cross-examination\" but was still an important witness.\"But for someone who is a convicted felon, an admitted liar, and not likable, he did better than expected. The prosecution did a good job getting bad evidence out on direct examination and through other witnesses,\" Rahmani said.\"That lowered the expectations for Cohen and took the sting out of the defense's attack. Cohen is still neither likable nor credible, so the state needed to corroborate his testimony with independent evidence,\" Rahmani added.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for 2024, is the first former president in U.S. history to stand trial in a criminal case. He has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records. He has continually said that this case and other criminal and civil challenges involving him are politically motivated.The prosecution seeks to prove that before the 2016 presidential election, Trump paid or discussed paying two women\u2014adult film star Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal\u2014to not disclose his alleged affairs with them. He denies affairs with both women.Newsweek sought email comment from Trump's attorney on Monday.Cross-examination of Cohen continued on Monday after two days the previous week.Under cross-examination on Monday, Cohen admitted that he told people, including reporters, that Donald Trump knew nothing about the Daniels payment when the news broke in early 2018.\"You didn't keep it quiet, right?\" Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked about Cohen's denial campaign on Trump's behalf. \"I did not,\" Cohen answered.Trump attorney Todd Blanche suggested that Cohen was very proud to be appointed as Trump's lawyer.\"You told everybody that was happening, correct?\" Blanche asks.\"Not everybody, but I certainly was proud of the role and I announced it,\" Cohen replied.Cohen also agreed that in 2017, the year Trump came to power, he made $4 million from six consulting clients. The clients included phone company AT&T, which paid him $50,000 per month for a year for working on its acquisition plans for Time Warner.Cohen also agreed that he took some of the cash paid by a company called Red Finch, which was intended for the Trump Organization.Asked by Blanche if he had stolen the money, Cohen replied: \"Yes, sir.\"Rahmani said that Cohen's cross-examination shows why it was important that the prosecution backed up his testimony with other evidence.This included Cohen's secret recording of Trump in which they allegedly talked about the hush money payment to Karen McDougal.",

        "text": "The mystery of just how the notorious cockroach became one of the most widespread vermin has been solved by scientists.The origins of the German cockroach (Blattella germanica)\u2014the one usually spotted scuttling through people's kitchens\u2014has remained somewhat of a mystery until now, as they are found in human-made structures around the world\u2014but almost nowhere in the wild.However, according to a new paper in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, modern cockroaches may have first arisen in India or Myanmar and migrated westwards over the past few thousand years.Cockroaches are a vast group of insects containing many species, but German cockroaches are one of the most common and troublesome pests found in homes, restaurants, and other human habitats. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, thriving in the warm, humid environments of kitchens and bathrooms, hiding in cracks, crevices, and other tight spaces. Their presence can lead to food contamination and spoilage, as they are known to spread various diseases, including Salmonella and E. coli.As their name suggests, German cockroaches were once thought to have originated in Europe, and were first described in Europe in the 1700s.\"The origin and spread of the German cockroach are shrouded in mystery. Described by Linnaeus in 1776 about a decade after the Seven Years' War, historical records have suggested a global spread of German cockroaches from Europe between the late 19th to early 20th centuries. However, the German cockroach has no close relatives in Europe; those are in Africa and Asia,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.Cockroaches appear to be closely related to the Asian cockroach, Blattella asahinai Mizukubo, which is native to the Bay of Bengal in Asia and is an invasive species across the southern U.S.\"The paradox of a European beginning but Asian phylogenetic affinity is likely due to the almost complete lack of systematic entomological knowledge across the world prior to the 20th century. To help fill the knowledge gap and solve this paradox, we used genome-wide markers from 281 samples from 17 countries around the world, from which we described the genetic structure and reconstructed spread routes of the German cockroach.\"The researchers found that, according to the genome analysis, the German cockroach likely evolved from the Asian cockroach Blatella asahinai over 2,000 years ago in India and Myanmar. These cockroaches then expanded to the west about 1,200 years ago, and only reached Germany about 250 years ago. They then spread to the rest of the world around 1900, using modern transport and indoor heating to expand and thrive.\"While Europe was not central to the early domestication and spread of the German cockroach, European advances in long-distance transportation and temperature-controlled housing were likely important for the more recent global spread, increasing chances of successful dispersal to and establishment in new regions,\" the researchers wrote.This discovery of the cockroach's evolutionary history and genome may help develop ways to get around these vermin's pest control resistance, as well as helping to tackle infestations of the bugs.\"Future studies could focus on the functional genomic aspects of this admixture to understand German cockroaches' rapid spread, evolution of insecticide resistance, and so inform better integrated pest management,\" the researchers wrote.Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "text": "Judges in Georgia recently received thousands of pages of new documents in the case involving attempts to have Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis removed from former President Donald Trump's election interference trial.Officials from Fulton County Superior Court sent the documents to the Georgia Court of Appeals for review, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Monday.The documents include transcripts from defendants who are seeking to have Willis removed from Trump's election interference case in the state, such as Michael Roman, the Journal-Constitution said, adding that there are roughly 1,700 pages of transcripts for each of the defendants.The report comes shortly after an appeals court in Georgia agreed to consider Trump's appeal of the disqualification matter related to Willis and attorney Nathan Wade. Earlier this year, Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the case in Fulton County, announced that Willis could remain on Trump's election interference case as long as Wade, who was in a romantic relationship with Willis, stepped down from the case.Trump and several other co-defendants, including Roman, previously moved to have Willis taken off the case over her relationship with Wade, who was appointed as a special prosecutor in the Fulton County District Attorney's Office.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he broke the law attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election result in Georgia. It is one of four criminal cases Trump is facing as he makes his bid for a second White House term.In April, one of Trump's co-defendants in the election interference case, Harrison Floyd, shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, calling for Willis to recuse herself from the case.\"I don't want to put a black woman in Jail. But if Fani Willis does not recuse herself from this case by noon on Monday, I may have no other choice than to pursue all lawful remedies. Make Fulton Great Again,\" Floyd wrote.In his post, Floyd posted part of an article, purportedly from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, suggesting that Willis' office shared a recording of a conversation Willis had with his attorney, Carlos J.R. Salvado, in an unrelated criminal case in Maryland.Willis on Tuesday will face off against attorney Christian Wise Smith in the Democratic primary for the Fulton County district attorney seat. Although there have been legal efforts to remove her, this will mark her first time facing voters since indicting Trump and his allies.Newsweek reached out to the Fulton County District Attorney's Office via email for comment.",

Earlier this year, the case widened to allege that Digital Currency Group and Genesis, along with their top executives, defrauded investors of $2 billion.\"When investors suffer losses because of fraud and manipulation, they deserve to be made whole,\" James said in a statement. \"We see the real-world consequences and detrimental losses that can happen because of a lack of oversight and regulation within the cryptocurrency industry. New York investors deserve the peace of mind that comes from a properly regulated marketplace.\"The AG's office said that it will establish a Victims' Fund that will get be paid from Genesis' assets after a bankruptcy process the company is going through has settled terms with creditors.Read more: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether Price Predictions\"If those creditors are not made whole based on today's digital asset values, the Victims' Fund will receive up to $2 billion from Genesis' remaining assets,\" James' office said in the statement. \"The Victims' Fund will then make distributions to compensate Genesis' creditors for the full and fair amounts of their actual losses until the Victims' Fund is depleted.\"The 29,000 New Yorkers affected had invested more than $1 billion in Genesis through the Gemini Earn investment vehicle, the AG said in the statement.James' office described the settlement as the largest against a cryptocurrency firm in New York. The agreement also strips Genesis of the right to operate in the state.The settlement is contingent upon approval from the bankruptcy court. Genesis has not accepted guilt.\"Under this settlement, Genesis neither admits nor denies the allegations of this lawsuit, and the suit will continue against the remaining defendants, as well as Genesis' former business partner, Gemini Trust Company, LLC,\" the AG's office said.Read more: Compare the Best Investment AppsIn January 2023, Genesis, which operated as a crypto lender, filed for bankruptcy, part of a move the company said was geared to find \"global resolution\" for its clients.\"At this time, redemptions and new loan originations in the lending business remain suspended, and claims will be addressed through the Chapter 11 process,\" the company said at the time.On Friday, a judge approved the bankruptcy plan that will aim to give back $3 billion to customers, Reuters reported.Reached for comment on Monday, a Genesis spokesperson shared a statement with Newsweek and said the company would not comment beyond it.\"Our goal throughout this process has been to maximize value for all creditors, and we are gratified that the court approved both our Plan and the NYAG settlement agreement.

        "text": "A new interview with Kid Rock is drawing negative reactions, notably after the longtime rock-and-country singer reportedly pulled out a gun while purportedly intoxicated and also casually used the N-word.Kid Rock, whose real name is Bob Ritchie, spoke with Rolling Stone's David Peisner at his sprawling Nashville, Tennessee, property about his career and how he \"went from America's favorite hard-partying rock star to a MAGA [Make America Great Again] mouthpiece.\"The article is based on the evolution of Ritchie's career, spurred by his 1998 album Devil Without a Cause that sold more than 14 million albums and cemented his place across the musical spectrum.But in recent years he has arguably become known more for his political views, including being one of the first public figures to push for a boycott of Bud Light after the company partnered with transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney in 2023\u2014leading to a months-long slump in sales due to backlash from some conservative consumers.Ritchie, who is also an avid supporter of Donald Trump\u2014described in the interview as \"one of his besties\"\u2014predicted that the former president and presumptive Republican nominee will win his home state of Michigan this November. Ritchie was among the first celebrities to openly endorse Trump during his 2016 campaign.One portion of the interview, according to Peisner, involved Ritchie switching his drink of choice from white wine to Jim Beam and Coke. He proceeded to \"shout\" at Peisner, who claimed that a black handgun was pulled out while Ritchie was seated in a leather chair.\"And I got a f****** god**** gun right here if I need it!\" Ritchie yelled, per Peisner. \"I got them everywhere!\"Peisner includes the claim that Ritchie, throughout the course of the approximate two-hour interview, also demonized immigrants and at one point exclaimed \"9/11!\"Ritchie also purportedly used the N-word countless times during the interview, in reference to what his father said around him earlier in his life\u2014as well as while referencing rappers from Detroit who allegedly told him that Trump is the right person to lead the country.Newsweek has reached out to Ritchie's manager via social media for comment.\"It's worth mentioning these are not the only times Ritchie drops the N-word during my visit,\" Peisner writes. \"It'd be easy to label this as the rantings of a drunk racist, but as with everything that Ritchie does, it's hard to know how calculated it all is.\"Is he just trying to get a reaction? Is he begging to be pilloried when this story comes out so he can launch into a very public tirade against 'cancel culture'\"?The interview, conducted hours before Ritchie appeared on Fox News' Ingraham Angle hosted by Laura Ingraham while wearing a Bud Light hat that was criticized by the host, has resulted in more criticism of Ritchie.\"You're not gonna believe this, but Kid Rock is a drunk, racist, rich white trash conspiracy theorist who waves guns in people's faces and uses the N-word with alarming regularity,\" wrote user @TrumpsTaxes on X, formerly Twitter. \"In other words he's full MAGA.\"\"WTF? Kid rock calls Rolling Stone journalist the N-word and pulls out a handgun??? Is this true?\" wrote @mjfree.Another user with the handle @MichellesDude wrote: \"#MAGA Are the Dregs of Society, Episode 28,652: Kid Rock gets drunk on Jim Beam during interview, waves a gun around, uses N-word. Total #trash.\"\"Just a reminder that Kid Rock's dad owned a string of car dealerships in Michigan and he grew up in a very wealthy household,\" wrote user @EDogtheRed. \"Though he acts like he's 'straight out the trailer,' he's really straight out the gated community.\"Peisner reported that as the interview concluded and he attempted to leave the property, Ritchie purportedly said in a \"whispering\" tone: \"Would you do me a favor? Just write the most horrific article about me. Do it. It helps me.\"",

        "text": "Ukraine is eagerly awaiting the first shipments of F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets from its Western allies, desperately needed hardware that Kyiv hopes will help it counter Russia's air superiority after more than two years of grueling war.After months of diplomatic pressure, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky finally secured the long-awaited aircraft from NATO allies Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium, all of whom donated their fleets to the Ukrainian Air Force. Since early April, the U.S. and its allies have been training Ukrainian pilots on the American-made jets, which are expected to be delivered within weeks. Zelensky has said he needs 120 to 130 of the warplanes to achieve \"parity\" with Moscow.Ukraine hopes those F-16s will help its military match the aerial capabilities of Russia's fleet of Su-57 jets, which have been deployed since the early days of the conflict.But while the F-16 brings proven reliability and versatility to Ukraine's defense, the Su-57's advanced stealth capabilities present a formidable challenge.Russia's fifth-generation fighter boasts advanced stealth technology, 3D thrust vectoring engines and a diverse array of weaponry.According to Russian military documents, the Su-57 is capable of flying at \"more than twice the speed of sound,\" at altitudes of nearly 60,000 feet and a range of more than 1,800 miles.Armament includes radar-guided or infrared-homing (\"heat-seeking\") air-to-air missiles, unguided air-to-ground rockets, conventional bombs, cluster bombs and a gun firing 30-mm exploding shells.The twin-engine stealth fighter, developed by Russian defense giant Sukhoi in the early 2000s, has roots that trace back to the Cold War era. During that period, the Soviets identified the need for a next-generation fighter to succeed their Su-27 and MiG-29 fleets in frontline tactical operations.But the Su-57 faced production delays and performance issues, particularly with its engines and stealth features. Some military aviation experts argue that the warplane's visible round engine nozzles increase its ability to be detected by radar, undermining its stealth capabilities.Despite those shortcomings, the Su-57, or \"Felon,\" has some advantages over the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Defense-specialized magazine National Interest reports that the fifth-generation Felon can synchronize with ground radars, giving it a first-launch advantage over the fourth-generation model.The F-16 Fighting Falcon has a long track record of combat success. Known for its versatility and maneuverability, it has been a staple in numerous air forces since the late 1970s.Initially designed as a lightweight air superiority day fighter, the jet has evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft. The F-16's flexibility, combined with a wide array of upgrades over the years, including advanced radar, avionics and weapon systems, makes it a robust fighter for the demands of modern aerial combat.The F-16 can fly at speeds over Mach 2 (about 1,500 mph) and operate at altitudes up to 50,000 feet, slightly lower than the Su-57. It has a combat radius of approximately 340 miles with internal fuel and a ferry range exceeding 2,000 miles with external tanks.The American jets also include upgraded radar systems like the AN/APG-66, which can track targets both in the air and on the ground over a range of more than 60 miles. They can carry a larger and more diverse array of weapons than either the Soviet MiG-29 or the Su-57, including missiles, bombs, and anti-radar weapons.The fighters will replace Ukraine's strained and thinning fleet of MiG-29s, Su-24s and Su-25s \u2014 jets that came of age at the height of the Cold War and whose capabilties are now well known to the Russians.However, a report by the U.S. General Accounting Office last year ranked the F-16 as one of the most difficult Air Force planes to maintain. That fact, according to Mark Cancian, a retired U.S. Marine Colonel and senior adviser with the Center for Strategic & International Studies Security Program, may be as challenging for the Ukrainians as actually flying the aircraft.\"For the F-16s to be effective, Ukraine needs to establish and maintain extensive support and logistics infrastructure,\" Cancian told Newsweek. \"This includes training pilots, which takes about nine months, and setting up systems for maintenance, refueling, and ammunition supply.\"\"It will not be an immediate game-changer,\" he added.",

        "text": "Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi died in a mysterious helicopter crash in northern Iran on Sunday, shocking the world and sparking a litany of conspiracy theories.Raisi, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and seven other people were killed after the helicopter went down in heavy fog, officials said.While the cause of the crash is yet to be confirmed, many observers and social media users have speculated about who or what could be behind it\u2014and the culprits range from enemy countries and internal rivals to simply the weather or a mechanical fault.Here is a list of the possible suspects.As news of Raisi's death was reported, many were quick to point the finger at Israel, a longtime regional enemy of Iran.Despite Israel denying involvement, according to officials quoted by Israeli TV station Channel 13, and there being no evidence connecting it to the incident, speculation about the country's involvement has spread like wildfire on social media.In response to the conspiracy theories, journalist Yashar Ali wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"A reminder that not even the Islamic Republic regime is blaming the death of Raisi on Israel...so if you're a white person from Brooklyn you shouldn't be either.\"Several X accounts incorrectly reported that Israeli media had confirmed Raisi's death before the news was made public.A reporter for a French TV station even mistakenly reported as a rumor a joke on Telegram and X that Raisi's helicopter had been piloted by a Mossad agent named \"Eli Kopter.\"Tensions between Israel and Iran have reached new heights in recent months, escalating to the point of Iran launching hundreds of drones and ballistic missiles at Israel.The incident was the first direct military confrontation between the two countries after years of shadow and proxy warfare.Israel has also been accused of killing various Iranian figures over the years, including Revolutionary Guard members in Syria and Iranian nuclear scientists.The helicopter crashed following a trip to the neighboring country of Azerbaijan. Some have pointed out that the former Soviet republic is known to have close ties to Israel.One person who will likely benefit from Raisi's death is Mojtaba Khamenei, the son of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.In Iran's theocratic system, the supreme leader is the ultimate decision-maker, rather than the president.For years, it has been speculated that Raisi or Mojtaba are the two contenders to succeed Khamenei. Raisi's death clears the path for Mojtaba to become the likely successor.Several people took to social media to point out the rivalry and to speculate that Mojtaba could have somehow been behind the crash.\"A person considered on a shortlist with Raisi as successor to the Supreme Leader is the Supreme leader's son Mojtaba. Say what you want but when someone has both motive and opportunity to commit homicide an accident is just one possibility,\" one X user wrote.Others simply noted how Mojtaba will benefit from Raisi's death.\"President Raisi didnt run Iran, but he wanted to. Was a front runner to be next Supreme Leader. Now Ayatollah Khameini's son Mojtaba has one less rival for the top job,\" author Tim Marshall noted on X.There is no evidence to suggest Mojtaba had anything to do with the helicopter crash.Many people have noted that the helicopter Raisi was in was likely 30 years old, manufactured in 1994.The U.S.-made Bell 212 is the civilian counterpart to a Vietnam-era UH-1N \"Twin Huey\" helicopter and was likely purchased by Iran during the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.Bell 212s are flown by organizations across the world, and the helicopter is known for its longevity.However, questions have been raised about whether the one Raisi was in was too old and not properly maintained. Because of international sanctions, Iran repairs its own aircraft through smuggling parts and reverse-engineering.Raisi's helicopter was one of three traveling in formation but was the only one to make a \"hard landing.\" The other two helicopters safely reached their destination.One X account run by a Pakistan-based open-source intelligence team said that the helicopter should not have been flown in these conditions.\"If the pilot and/or flight planners put their passengers on an aging and unreliable helicopter without IFR avionics and flew it in IMC conditions then the flight's planner, pilots and the entire presidential squadron was basically asking for this to happen. Gross negligence. Bordering on unintentional man-slaughter,\" the account wrote.IFR refers to Instrument Flight Rules, meaning that an aircraft is able to fly without visual cues for the pilot, relying on instruments to navigate safely. IMC conditions refers to inclement weather.Another less dramatic theory is that the crash was simply caused by bad weather.The helicopter went down in dense fog, which also complicated the search-and-rescue mission, Iranian officials said.Some experts have noted that flying in low visibility in the mountainous terrain can be dangerous.\"If the weather is bad, the pilot has choices and if you cannot go above the weather, you should turn around or land. There really aren't any technical solutions here,\" Simon Sparkes, a military helicopter test pilot and aviation expert, told The National.Another ongoing source of tension in Iran is unrest caused by separatist militants, which have been known to carry out attacks on Iranian security officials.Dozens of Iranian security personnel were killed in multiple attacks in southeastern Iran in April.The attacks were claimed by Jaish al-Adl, a Baloch separatist militant group that operates around the Iran-Pakistan border and is designated by the United States as a terrorist organization.Iran's southeastern region has long been the site of frequent clashes between Iranian security forces and Sunni separatist fighters.While there is no evidence to suggest that the separatists would have the means or the ability to down a presidential helicopter, they have long been hostile to Raisi.",

        "text": "New interim Iranian President Mohammad Mokhber received scrutiny for his role in the lack of development of a domestic vaccine at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.Mokhber assumed his duties on Monday having been appointed by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei following the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash on Sunday.Along with Raisi, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Tabriz Friday prayers leader Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Ale-Hashem, East Azerbaijan Governor General Malek Rahmati and an unspecified number of guards and crew members died in the crash\u2014which was attributed to heavy fog. The helicopter was found Monday after a drone identified a thermal signal from the destroyed aircraft.Mokhber, 68, has been a familiar face in the Iranian government. Before Raisi made him vice president following in 2021, Mokhber headed the Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order (EIKO)\u2014also known as the Setad\u2014for some 14 years.As part of that role in the wake of the coronavirus, Mokhber vowed that Iran would make and distribute tens of millions of COVID vaccine doses. But his promise never materialized beyond the state's only manufactured vaccine called COVIran Barekat, which officials in February 2021 claimed was 90 percent effective against coronavirus, according to Al-Jazeera.At that time, the only vaccines approved internationally were the U.S.-German Pfizer, U.S.-made Moderna and the British-made AstraZeneca.When Khamenei banned such vaccines inside Iran, according to the Iran International Newsroom, hundreds of millions of dollars were distributed among government-run companies with no experience in vaccine development to produce a homegrown variant.The alleged COVID mismanagement led to a shift under Raisi, who rescinded the Western vaccine ban introduced by Khamenei and allowed Chinese and AstraZeneca vaccines.Peer-reviewed research published in May 2023 by researchers in association with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Yale University, including many of Iranian descent, studied how Iran's delayed vaccine rollout likely led to excess deaths.The study compared Iran to eight model countries with similar income brackets and dominant COVID-19 vaccine types, finding that faster vaccine rollouts led to a higher number of deaths being averted.\"While Iran's percentage of fully vaccinated individuals would have been similar to Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Turkey under counterfactual rollout rates, adopting Turkey's rates could have averted up to 50,000 more deaths, whereas following Bangladesh's rates could have led to up to 52,800 additional losses of lives in Iran,\" the study said.The World Health Organization (WHO) said that after Iran's first COVID case was detected on February 19, 2020, up until February 28, 2022, the Islamic state reported more than 6.6 million cases and approximately 140,000 deaths.\"Amid the rapid spread of new variants as the pandemic evolved, Iran's limited capacity to effectively conduct genomic sequencing significantly hampered surveillance and tracking of SARS-CoV-2 variants and inform Iran's pandemic response,\" the WHO said.The Johns Hopkins University of Medicine, in a study of mortality rates last updated on March 16, 2023, showed Iran with the fourth-highest number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases\u2014known as case-fatality ratio.Iran's 1.9 percent rate trailed only Peru (4.9 percent), Mexico (4.5 percent) and Ukraine (2.1 percent).",

        "text": "Iran interim President Mohammad Mokhber is close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and has long-standing ties to his country's military establishment, reportedly helping Tehran to broker a deal to supply weapons to Russia's military.Formerly the vice president, Mokhber has temporarily taken over the presidency following the death of Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash on Sunday, which also killed Iran's foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials.\"Mokhber's leadership style might differ from Raisi's in certain respects,\" Sina Toossi, a senior nonresident fellow at the Center for International Policy, told Newsweek. \"While Raisi was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei with a judicial background and a strong ideological bent, Mokhber is likely to bring a more technocratic approach to the presidency.\"Mokhber, 68, served as governor in his home province of Khuzestan, which borders Iraq and the Persian Gulf. He became his country's first vice president in 2021 when Raisi, a hard-liner, was elected president in a tightly controlled ballot.\"During the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, he served in the Revolutionary Guards' medical corps, underscoring his long-standing ties to the country's military establishment,\" said Toossi.He has a substantial background in managing key economic and administrative institutions closely tied to Khamenei, heading the powerful Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order (EIKO), as well as serving as a deputy at the Mostazafan Foundation.Both of these are large business conglomerates integral to the supreme leader's patronage network, said Toossi. \"These organizations are deeply embedded in Iran's economic landscape, with significant holdings in finance, energy, construction, and mining sectors.\"In 2012 Mokhber was removed from a European Union sanctions list he had been placed on two years earlier for involvement in \"nuclear or ballistic missile activities.\"In 2021, Mokhber was sanctioned by the United States over EIKO's role in \"confiscating land and property from opponents of the regime\" and other human rights abuses.Meanwhile, in October 2022, Mokhber was among Iranian officials who visited Moscow where they agreed to supply surface-to-surface missiles and more drones to Russia's military, according to Reuters.Since the start of Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has relied on Iranian weaponry and know how, using so-called \"kamikaze\" or Shahed drones in hitting Ukrainian targets.As interim president, Mokhber is part of a three-person council, along with the speaker of Parliament and the head of the judiciary, which will organize a new presidential election within 50 days.Mokhber's main task is to manage the transition ahead of the upcoming presidential election. Khamenei's authority means that there is unlikely to be any substantial policy shifts, especially in foreign relations in the interim period.\"Mokhber's focus will likely be on maintaining stability and continuity rather than introducing significant changes,\" said Toossi.",

The specific chopper that crashed on Sunday had been configured to carry government passengers.Experts believe that the Iranian helicopter, designed for visual flight conditions \u2014 or clear weather \u2014 likely encountered heavy fog amid a passing storm on Sunday, impairing the pilot's visibility and contributing to the crash. The incident has raised concerns about the maintenance and longevity of Iran's aging fleet under Western sanctions.In the late 1970s, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, invested in creating a top-of-the-line fleet for Iran's Air Force (IRIAF), purchasing over 300 Bell 212s and 214s, alongside AH-1 Super Cobras and Chinooks. Those plans screeched to a halt during the Islamic Revolution in 1979.After the revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the newly formed Air Force saw most Western-made aircraft fall into disrepair, worsened by the U.S. arms embargo against the Islamic Republic's government.Since then, Tehran has kept its aging fleet operational by reusing existing parts and receiving assistance from Russia and China.Despite the challenges in acquiring parts and new aircraft, the IRIAF has managed to maintain a degree of operational readiness by overhauling and upgrading some of its surviving military aircraft.The Washington Institute, a U.S. think tank, says accidents in the IRIAF are relatively high compared to other nations. Iran has experienced at least 13 aviation accidents and 14 fatalities reported over a five-year period.In the hours following the crash of the chopper carrying Raisi, Iran's former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, suggested to Iranian state TV that American sanctions indirectly contributed to the crash by preventing Iran from acquiring new aircraftAccording to an interview cited by Iran International and ISNA News Agency, Zarif said that the crash that killed Raisi would be \"recorded in the blacklist of American crimes against the Iranian nation.\"Iranian authorities are prohibited from purchasing aircraft that contain more than 10% U.S.-made parts, according to the Washington Institute.A 2024 report by Flight Global claimed that at least two Bell 212s and 24 Bell 214s were still operating in Iran. Iran's civilian airlines also operate some of the world's oldest aircraft, with an estimated average fleet age of over 25 years.",

If things don't change, I'll be finished,\" one business owner said in the report.Already, businesses are making moves to preserve their cash flows. Four in 10 now said they are delaying paying bills while a whopping seven in 10 have put all staffing plans on hold, the survey found.\"It's been a difficult three years for America's small businesses,\" Michael Seifert, PublicSquare CEO, said in the report. \"While many inside the Beltway may feel like things are good, that isn't translating to Main Street America\u2014the frontlines of our small business economy.\"PublicSquare is the conservative \"anti-woke\" marketplace aiming to compete with Amazon.\"Just like families all across the nation, many small business owners are now in bill paying triage,\" Andrew Crapuchettes, RedBalloon CEO, said in the report. \"All of the government reports and happy-talk from Washington DC doesn't change that Americans continue wrestling with inflation, and a majority of small business owners now predict we'll slip into stagflation.\"While inflation stood at 3.4 percent in April, not everyone believes Biden's presidency is directly related to the economic turmoil many businesses face.HR consultant Bryan Driscoll questioned whether any of Biden's actual economic policies were the reason for the small business's troubled finances.\"The discussion today simply happens to occur when a Democrat is in the White House. The same conversation could also happen with a Republican but rarely does because Republicans have better messaging about how they're better for small business,\" Driscoll said. \"Spoiler: they're not.\"For some businesses, Biden's pro-worker policies could create temporary financial stress for businesses that \"fail to innovate or manage their finances effectively,\" Driscoll said.\"If a business can't afford to pay its workers fairly or handle economic fluctuations, it might indicate inefficiencies within the business itself rather than flaws in national economic policy,\" Driscoll said.And when it comes to a second Biden or Trump presidency, Driscoll said both would have significantly different implications for the small business owners both long and short term.\"Biden's approach is more likely to lead to long-term stability and growth by focusing on the workforce,\" Driscoll said. \"While some businesses might feel immediate pressure, those that adapt will ultimately thrive in a fairer economic landscape. Conversely, a Trump presidency could lead to short-term gains for businesses but potentially at the cost of worker welfare and long-term sustainability. After all, if a business can't afford to pay its workers fairly, how does it expect those same workers to afford the products and services they help create?\"A separate survey from CNBC last year showed only 30 percent of small business owners approved of Biden's policies, and 56 percent said they \"strongly disapprove\" of the way he's handled his presidency.",

Foss has over 15 years of experience as an attorney specializing in business reorganizations, including Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases.On Monday, restaurant liquidator TAGeX Brands wrote that it was auctioning the kitchen equipment, furniture and other contents of over 50 Red Lobster restaurants across the country. The closures, though not officially confirmed by Red Lobster, were apparent on their website, where dozens of locations were listed as temporarily shut down.Newsweek contacted Red Lobster for comment by email on Tuesday but received no response. In a statement to Newsweek, Thai Group, who owns a 25 percent stake in Red Lobster, wrote: \"Thai Union Group is in the process of exiting its minority investment in Red Lobster (Thai Union never owned Red Lobster). Please understand that we do not wish to comment further.\"According to reports, Red Lobster failed to notify employees that the restaurants they worked in were closing. An alleged employee, @haileyreneeee, wrote on X on Monday: \"I lost my job today without warning and working Mother's Day yesterday.\" In a follow-up post, she added: \"I'm one of the lucky ones who don't have kids or a house to pay off. Just so terrible leaving all those employees with nothing, no notice, anything.\"Foss said former employees might have grounds to sue the company, but Red Lobster might avoid them by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\"Despite the potential for litigation, Chapter 11 can be a useful tool for a restaurant or retail chain facing financial distress as it allows a debtor to renegotiate and reject burdensome leases and contracts, which are often a major financial strain on a distressed company in these sectors,\" she said.\"Although Red Lobster's path through bankruptcy is unclear, the company, which is a subsidiary of Thai Union Group, is likely considering both a sale as well as its standalone restructuring options.\"In March, several news media reported that Red Lobster was considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in an attempt to alleviate its financial troubles. The popular seafood chain has struggled to recover from the difficult years of the pandemic, facing a decline in both sales and profits, significant debt and unfavorable lease terms.Even the repeated turnover of executives and attempts to change the direction of the company didn't turn Red Lobster's situation around.The introduction of its \"Ultimate Endless Shrimp\" deal as a permanent feature of its regular menu last year, an offer that was meant to attract more customers to the chain's restaurants, spectacularly backfired against the company. While the deal, which offers customers all-you-can-eat shrimp for only $20, increased traffic to Red Lobster by 4 percent compared to the year before, according to Restaurant Business Magazine, but contributed to the company's $11 million losses in just one quarter.The future of the seafood chain is now uncertain, and it's possible that Red Lobster might still be considering bankruptcy.\"The bankruptcy filing would be the first from a major restaurant chain this year, which has seen a number of retailers and an even larger number of healthcare and telecommunications companies commence Chapter 11 proceedings,\" Foss said.",

Earlier in the year, the estimate was set at 2.6 and 2.4 percent.Read more: 7% Interest Rate Savings AccountsIf a 2.66 percent boost is implemented, it would likely increase monthly payments by around $50 for most recipients.While the jump in monthly benefits would be better than the earlier predictions, many seniors were expecting a higher boost to deal with the impacts of inflation.The Social Security Administration adjusts Social Security payment amounts every year based on the consumer price index, but not everyone feels the change would be enough to get by.\"While COLA payments will increase to offset the effects of inflation, the problem many have with the potential percentage jump is it won't get far enough to meet most of the financial needs of seniors,\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek. \"Obviously daily expenses for this age group continue to rise, but the uptick in healthcare costs are putting an additional strain on them, and COLA payments may not be enough to match that uptick.\"Read more: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts to Grow Your SavingsSeniors will also likely be dealing with higher Medicare Part premiums, according to TSCL.In the Medicare Trustee report from this month, Part B premiums were predicted to grow by $10.30 a month to a total of $185. That increase is on top of nationwide inflation on groceries, housing and transportation.\"For 2024, the average Social Security benefit rose by $50 and after subtracting $9.80 to cover Medicare Part B Premium increases, the total change in benefits came out to just $40.20 a month. With the forecast of a 2.66 percent COLA for 2025, it appears seniors will continue to suffer financial insecurity as much next year as they have this year,\" Shannon Benton, executive director of TSCL, said in a statement.The COLA for each year depends on the rise of the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) for the third quarter of the last year. That means the official COLA for 2025 won't be calculated until later in the year.Many finance experts have questioned whether the CPI-W even stands as a good measure of what seniors can expect inflation wise, with many saying the consumer price index for the elderly (CPI-E)In 2024, Social Security checks rose by 3.2 percent due to the COLA after a more generous increase of 8.7 percent last year. Many seniors, roughly 71 percent, reported in TSCL 2024 Senior Survey that the increase in household costs they saw went beyond the 3.2 percent jump from the COLA.Read more: Average Savings Account Rates\"The majority of seniors still feel like their costs are rising faster than those annual adjustments,\" Michael Ryan, a finance expert and founder/CEO of michaelryanmoney.com, told Newsweek. \"So while the COLA certainly helps, it often still doesn't fully cover the real inflation draining seniors' buying power.\"Due to the insufficient funds from Social Security for seniors, many will need additional income streams, including a 401(k), IRA or other investment accounts.\"At the end of the day, any COLA increase is better than none to prevent total Social Security stagnation,\" Ryan said. \"But the 2.6 percent projection for 2025 underscores the need for policymakers to reexamine whether metrics like CPI-E would better serve seniors by more accurately reflecting their unique spending habits. We just want to make sure government benefits retain as much purchasing power over time as possible on those fixed incomes.\"",

The jargon was intimidating, the user interfaces were clunky, and the general public viewed crypto as a mysterious, almost esoteric domain. It was in this environment that I stumbled upon crypto in a most unexpected way.Read more: Best Cryptocurrency to Invest InWhile pursuing a Ph.D. in physics, I encountered a cyberattack that inadvertently introduced me to the world of crypto. One day, our lab's computers were hacked, and we received a message from the attacker demanding payment in bitcoin to restore our systems. Faced with no other options, my team and I scrambled to understand this unfamiliar asset. We purchased bitcoin to pay the hacker. We ended up with some leftover bitcoin and, to our surprise, watched as its value started to increase shortly after the transaction.The urgency of the situation forced us to quickly learn about bitcoin, its acquisition and its utility. The rising value certainly sparked our curiosity too. We navigated through online exchanges, figuring out how to set up a digital wallet and purchase the necessary amount. This experience, though stressful, opened my eyes to the potential and volatility of cryptocurrencies. What initially seemed like a digital mishap turned into a gateway to a revolutionary financial technology.Read more: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether Price PredictionsAs I delved deeper, I was captivated by the immense potential of blockchain technology and these digital assets. However, it was immediately apparent that there was a steep knowledge gap. The barriers to entry were formidable, deterring many from exploring this groundbreaking field.It became increasingly clear that for crypto to realize its full potential, it needed to be demystified and simplified. Many people traded these digital assets using decentralized exchanges, and although in each cycle of the crypto market DEXs have been making incremental progress, there is still significant room for development. Continuous efforts are required to provide fair and transparent services to crypto users, and still more needs to be done to make these platforms accessible to a broader audience.That's why I founded JOJO\u2014an exchange for people to trade derivatives\u2014to address these issues comprehensively. Our approach involves offering extensive educational resources, prioritizing intuitive design and transparency and implementing simplified yet robust security measures. Our goal is to make derivatives trading accessible, understandable and secure for everyone.To help bridge the knowledge gap, we provide comprehensive guides, interactive tutorials and dedicated support to help users navigate the complex world of crypto. We aim to empower them with the knowledge they need to confidently engage with crypto. That demystifies what otherwise might appear complex, given JOJO's focus on a particular kind of trading popular in crypto that is known as \"perpetual futures.\" But simplifying platforms through intuitive design and transparency is crucial: Our platform offers clear, real-time updates on transaction statuses and uses an intuitive layout to minimize confusion, significantly enhancing user engagement and confidence.Read more: 11 Most Popular CryptocurrenciesTransparency is essential for building trust, so we enable users to easily track their transactions and understand each step of the process, fostering a sense of reliability through detailed explanations.

All transactions can be signed only by the user, and all liquidations are carried out on-chain. This means that no one can misappropriate users' assets, nor can anyone maliciously trigger liquidation.My journey from an unexpected, curious newcomer to the founder of a community-first crypto company has reinforced the critical importance of making crypto accessible to all. It's not just about catering to tech enthusiasts or early adopters. It's about ensuring that everyone, regardless of background or expertise, can participate in this transformative space. Universal access to crypto can democratize finance, foster innovation and reduce financial inequality.At JOJO, we are deeply committed to this vision. We believe that crypto has the power to reshape the financial landscape, democratizing access to financial services and empowering individuals around the world. Our goal is to create a future where the barriers to entry are significantly lowered, opening up opportunities for a diverse array of individuals to benefit from the potential of crypto.To achieve this vision, we focus on continuous improvement and a relentless dedication to user experience. By prioritizing the users in everything we do, we aim to lead the way in making crypto a truly inclusive financial tool.Lei Mingda is the co-founder of JOJO.

That's a significant drop from 1950 when the number was 97 percent.So while women are increasingly looking for work, many men are simply opting out.\"The U.S. has a major issue of prime-age men giving up and permanently exiting the labor force,\" Robin Brooks, a senior fellow policy research firm at the Brookings Institution and the former chief economist at IIF, wrote on X, formerly Twitter this month.\"What's striking about this is that it doesn't get talked about at all, not in the mainstream media and not by economists, even though this obviously feeds political radicalization.\"Men are opting out of the workforce for various reasons, but a key factor in the story is men's dwindling rates of higher education attainment. While women historically were left out of college education, they now outpace men at college roughly 60 to 40 percent.Not having a college degree invariably limits your employability, statistics show.Those with only a high school diploma have an unemployment rate of 3.9 percent compared to just 2.2 percent of those who achieved a bachelor's degree, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Other times, the desire to opt out of capitalist society might cause many to abandon the workforce altogether.Read more: Best Side Hustles\"Many jobs are simply not satisfying,\" Yvonne Vissing, a professor at Salem State University and an expert on the changing role of men in society, previously told Newsweek. \"Working for others who get the benefit of our physical labor and intellectual property is not rewarding either emotionally or financially. People want to work doing jobs that matter to us. We want to use our creativity. We want to matter, and in many businesses, employees simply don't get treated with the respect and support that we need and want. People walk away from them.\"In other cases, men have left the workforce to become stay-at-home parents, similar to many women today. Others rely on social safety net programs like Supplemental Security Income and Social Security for disabilities that might not have been recognized in earlier years.Still, that doesn't fully explain why at the same time women are working more while men are working less.If you ask HR consultant Bryan Driscoll, it could largely in part come down to a mental health crisis among men that is not often addressed within society or in the workplace.\"This tells me that even with the push to be more mindful and aware of employee's mental health issues and wellbeing, men are being left out,\" Driscoll told Newsweek.But if the trend continues, and men continue to fall out of the workforce, Driscoll foresees widespread social and economic implications.\"From a purely economic standpoint, a shrinking labor force reduces the potential for economic growth, limits our ability to fund social programs, and may contribute to skill shortages in critical industries,\" Driscoll said. \"Societally, the absence of young men from the workforce contributes to issues of social cohesion, increases dependency on welfare systems, and can exacerbate feelings of disenfranchisement and alienation.\"Still, it might not be time to sound the alarm yet. In some ways, the dwindling numbers of men in the workforce as women's working numbers climb higher could just reflect a leveling of the playing field, Driscoll said.\"The decline in male labor force participation could be seen as a leveling of the playing field, offering a silver lining by potentially opening more opportunities for women and addressing longstanding gender imbalances in employment,\" Driscoll said.Jennifer Lee Magas, vice president of Magas Media Consultants and an assistant professor at Texas Tech University, echoed this statement, saying today's lingering wage gap still shows there's plenty that still needs to be done to deliver true equity in the workforce.\"It's not about women replacing men, but rather an evolution of roles and opportunities,\" Magas told Newsweek. \"Female-dominated industries such as healthcare and education are experiencing growth, while traditionally male-dominated sectors like manufacturing are shrinking.\"",

        "text": "Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a lost centuries-old church near a medieval royal palace. The remains were found below a tennis court during excavations at the site of Visegr\u00e1d, a castle town in Hungary.The settlement, located north of the Hungarian capital of Budapest on the right bank of the Danube River, is known for its medieval citadel and royal palace ruins. The lost church once formed part of a former Franciscan monastery, the remains of which lie next to the palace's ruins.The monastery was founded by King Sigismund in A.D. 1425. Sigismund was king of Hungary starting in 1387 but also became the monarch of several other European kingdoms and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1433.The Holy Roman Empire was a political entity spanning the western, central and southern parts of Europe that lasted for around 1,000 years, from the tail end of the first millennium until its dissolution in 1806. Rather than being a single unitary state, the empire was a confederation of numerous small- and medium-sized political entities.Sometime after the monastery at Visegr\u00e1d was founded by Sigismund, the Church of the Virgin Mary was built at the site.In the first two days of the ongoing excavations, the remains of the church's sanctuary and its high altar were uncovered, the Visegr\u00e1d Renaissance development program's Facebook page reported. Archaeologists subsequently found a large crypt in front of the main altar, which appears to have been looted after the monastery was depopulated.Among the debris of the collapsed crypt, the skeletal remains of three individuals were found, Hungary's National Archaeological Institute said in a Facebook post.Based on the objects found next to the remains, such as several lead rifle bullets, it is believed that these people may have been soldiers. Archaeologists also found a copper bowl near them, which bears indentations that appear to have been made with weapons. This suggests that the church may have been used for defensive purposes.This evidence also indicates that the church may not only have experienced looting but also was the scene of a bloody confrontation.The church may have collapsed or been destroyed after 1544, when Visegr\u00e1d came under the control of the Ottoman Empire, which was established by Turkish tribes in Anatolia.This empire became one of the most powerful states in the world during the 15th and 16th centuries. At its greatest extent, it covered most of southeastern Europe as well as parts of North Africa and the Middle East, including the territory where Israel is now located.Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

It was founded by ancient Greek colonists in the seventh century B.C. and subsequently came under Roman rule in the third century B.C. and developed into a major settlement in the region.The ongoing excavations in Durr\u00ebs are revealing a residential area of the ancient city that archaeologists believe was home to local elites. The Roman indoor pool is the first of its kind to be discovered by archaeological excavations in Albania.It was here that the remains of the villa with the indoor pool were uncovered. The walls of the pool area were decorated with colorful frescoes, while the floor features a \"very well-preserved\" mosaic with geometric motifs, according to the Institute of Cultural Heritage. The tiles of the mosaic are made from various materials such as marble, stone, glass and ceramics.Near the pool, the archaeologists also uncovered a structure consisting of two shallow bathtubs covered in layers of mortar for waterproofing purposes.In the northern part of the villa excavation site, the archaeologists uncovered a large brick floor that could have been part of a bath facility, as well as the remains of several walls.The discoveries that the team made in the western part of the site, meanwhile, are of \"great\" interest, according to the Institute of Cultural Heritage. In this area, archaeologists identified fragments of decorations on the walls and ceilings of the villa, featuring various anthropomorphic and floral motifs.The findings at the site date the villa to between the first and fourth centuries. Experts believe that the complex was destroyed by a powerful earthquake that struck the region in the fourth century. This natural disaster is attested to in historical sources.Earlier this year, archaeologists announced the discovery of a remarkable Roman villa complex in Britain where a \"huge\" number of artifacts have been found, including a set of mysterious lead scrolls. The complex was unearthed at the site of a housing development called Brookside Meadows in the village of Grove, in southeastern England.Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

The plastic particles have been found in our food, water, air and even in human placenta.Read more: Compare Top Health Savings AccountsThe reason the discovery is of concern is because these microplastics contain a cocktail of different chemicals that have been shown to interrupt the body's natural release of hormones, potentially increasing our risk of reproductive disorders and certain cancers. They can also carry toxins like heavy metals on their surface.According to previous estimates, the average person consumes about a credit card's worth of these microplastics every single week, so it's no wonder that they have been found inside our bodies.In a new study, published in the journal Toxicological Sciences, researchers from the University of New Mexico analyzed anonymized postmortem tissue from 23 human testes provided by the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, as well as 46 canine tissue samples from the City of Albuquerque animal shelters and private veterinary clinics.Microplastics were present in 100 percent of the samples tested, with an average concentration of 329.44 micrograms per gram in humans and 122.63 micrograms per gram in dogs.\"At the beginning, I doubted whether microplastics could penetrate the reproductive system [at all],\" Xiaozhong \"John\" Yu, a professor at the University of New Mexico's College of Nursing and leader of the study, said in a statement. \"When I first received the results for dogs I was surprised. I was even more surprised when I received the results for humans.\"Further testing on the dog samples demonstrated that higher levels of certain types of plastic in the testis tissue\u2014specifically PVC\u2014was correlated with lower sperm counts.\"The plastic makes a difference\u2014what type of plastic might be correlated with potential function,\" Yu said. \"PVC can release a lot of chemicals that interfere with [sperm production] and it contains chemicals that cause endocrine disruption.\"Over the past 50 years, sperm counts in the U.S. have declined by 50 percent, which the researchers believe may be partially influenced by the presence of these microplastics.\"These findings highlight the pervasive presence of microplastics in the male reproductive system in both canine and human testes, with potential consequences on male fertility,\" they write.However, more research is needed to confirm how these plastics might affect sperm production in humans. \"We have a lot of unknowns,\" Yu said. \"We need to really look at the potential long-term effect.\"He added: \"We don't want to scare people.

        "text": "The extremely low Antarctic sea ice levels in 2023 were even more \"surprising\" than scientists thought, a study has found.In 2023, over 770,000 square miles less ice than usual was recorded on the continent. New research published in the Geophysical Research Letters aimed to look more closely at this event and found that even with climate change contributing to sea ice loss, it is exceptionally rare.The scientists reached these findings by using satellites and a large climate dataset. They then compared 18 different climate models to assess how likely such an event was. By doing this, the scientists were able to see how such a large sea ice loss was linked to climate change.And while 2023's extreme lack of sea ice was linked to climate change, the models still show that this is extremely rare, even under multiple climate scenarios, the study said.\"This is the first time this large set of climate models has been used to find out how unlikely 2023's low sea ice actually was,\" said the study's lead author, Rachel Diamond of the British Antarctic Survey, in a statement. \"We only have forty-five years of satellite measurements of sea ice, which makes it extremely difficult to evaluate changes in sea ice extent. This is where climate models come into their own.\"She continued: \"According to the models, the record-breaking minimum sea ice extent would be a one-in-a-2000-year event without climate change. This tells us that the event was very extreme\u2014anything less than one-in-100 is considered exceptionally unlikely.\"Around 10 percent of the Earth's land area is ice, and 90 percent of this is in Antarctica, with the rest in Greenland, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Ice levels are highly important to the global climate, as they form protective layers over the Earth and keep the planet cool. The bright white ice then reflects excess heat back into space.But as the climate warms, the ice is in big trouble. Climate change, exacerbated by human activities and greenhouse gases, is melting Antarctic ice at a quick rate. The continent is losing ice mass at a rate of 150 billion tons per year, according to NASA. This also contributes to rising sea levels, which could have a global impact.Other recent research, published in April by the University of Miami and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, found that the warming of Antarctica's deep waters is hastening sea level rise in the North Atlantic.They discovered that a key ocean current system called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation has weakened by about 12 percent. This is warming deeper waters in the south, which is causing a sea level rise in the North Atlantic.The researchers in the new study also assessed the likelihood of sea ice recovering after such a large loss in 2023. They discovered that it is very unlikely for the ice to return, even after two decades.This suggests that 2023's event could have caused a lasting impact in the Antarctic (or Southern) Ocean.\"The impacts of Antarctic sea ice staying low for over twenty years would be profound, including on local and global weather and on unique Southern Ocean ecosystems \u2014 including whales and penguins,\" Louise Sime, another co-author of the study, said in the statement.The exact reason for the low ice levels in 2023 needs more research, but scientists know there are many complex factors. They include warming ocean surface temperatures as well as changes in wind variations. This new study and others like it are necessary to find out more about the lasting effect of these huge ice losses.Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

These microbes\u2014collectively known as the gut microbiome\u2014play a role in everything from our metabolism to our mental health. Research has increasingly shown that these intestinal microbes may influence our behavior too.Read more: What Is a Health Savings Account?In a new study, published in the journal PNAS Nexus, researchers from the Paris Brain Institute and the University of Bonn in Germany set about investigating whether the composition of our microbiomes could influence our decision-making, specifically in social contexts.The team recruited 101 participants, of which around half were given dietary supplements for seven weeks including both probiotics (so-called \"good\" bacteria) and prebiotics (nutrients known to promote the colonization of healthy bacteria in our guts). The rest received a placebo treatment. Before and after the intervention, participants gave blood and stool samples and were also subjected to an established behavioral test known as the \"ultimatum game.\"In the ultimatum game, one player is given a sum of money that must be split, fairly or unfairly, with a second player, who is free to decline the offer should they deem it insufficient. However, if they decline, neither player gets any money.Read more: Compare Top Health Savings AccountsThis behavior is known by psychologists as \"altruistic punishment,\" whereby punishing the unfair behavior is more important than receiving any money yourself. As a result, the game is often used as an experimental way of measuring an individual's sensitivity to fairness.After seven weeks on pro- and prebiotics, participants were much more likely to reject unequal offers than they were at the start of the study, even when the money split was only slightly unbalanced. The control group, meanwhile, showed no significant change in behavior between the start and end of the study.By studying the participants' blood and stool samples, the researchers demonstrated how their supplement intervention significantly changed the composition of the participants' gut microbiomes, with the biggest changes in behavior seen in those who had the \"unhealthiest\" microbiomes at the start of the study.\"These results improve our understanding of the bidirectional role body-brain interactions play in social decision-making and why humans at times act 'irrationally' according to standard economic theory,\" the authors write.\"Our findings challenge the classical view in cognitive sciences that complex behaviors such as social decision-making are only a function of higher cognitive processes located in cortical brain areas.\"Here, with a subtle dietary intervention over the course of seven weeks, we demonstrated for the first time (to the best of our knowledge) a causal effect of changing the gut microbiome on altruistic punishment behavior.\"It truly brings a whole new meaning to \"going with your gut.\"Is there a health problem that's worrying you?

They also selected left-handed pitcher Clayton Andrews to the active roster and designated right-handed pitcher Colby White for assignment.This is the first time the Yankees have used the COVID-19 IL since 2022. The COVID-19 IL was implemented in 2020, when the Coronavirus was rampant and MLB needed a way for players to be placed on an injured list that followed the timeline of the CDC guidelines. Players were forced to be out for a minimum of seven days, and that still stands today.In Aug. 2023, the Boston Red Sox placed left-handed pitcher Brennan Bernardino on the COVID-19 IL. Hamilton is the first player placed on the COVID-19 IL by any MLB team since then.Hamilton, 28, has been one of the Yankees' better relievers this season, sporting a 3.18 ERA in 22.2 innings pitched. He's picking up where he left off in 2023, when he had a 2.64 ERA in 58 innings pitched.Hamilton has been struggling as of late, though, as he has a 5.06 ERA over the last two weeks of play. He will now be out for a minimum of seven days, meaning his first potential return date is May 26.Hamilton was drafted in the 11th round of the 2016 MLB Draft by the Chicago White Sox. He bounced around a handful of teams before signing as a free agent with the Yankees in Jan. 2023.In his place, the left-handed Andrews will get an opportunity. Andrews has a career 27.00 ERA in four appearances at the MLB level with the Milwaukee Brewers. He has a 6.60 ERA in 12 appearances at Triple-A this season.Hamilton has been one of the many reasons the Yankees enter Monday with the tied-for-best bullpen ERA in baseball at 2.49. The Yankees have enjoyed incredible success from a handful of relievers, including the best closer in baseball up to this point.Right-handed pitcher Clay Holmes, the team's closer, has yet to allow an earned run in 20 innings, and has 13 saves. Alongside him have been some standout performances such as right-handed pitcher Nick Burdi (1.04 ERA in 8.2 innings), right-handed pitcher Luke Weaver (2.25 ERA in 28 innings), and left-handed pitcher Victor Gonz\u00e1lez (2.63 ERA in 13.2 innings).The Yankees enter Monday's series opener against the Seattle Mariners with the best record in the American League at 33-15. They'll look to continue this success without Hamilton for at least the next week.",

The announcement comes as the French team evaluates potential changes due to current performance challenges and expiring driver contracts.As the Formula 1 paddock keeps a keen eye on driver movements for the 2025 season, one name that continues to surface is Mick Schumacher. The German driver, who is currently competing in the World Endurance Championship (WEC) with Alpine after his exit from a full-time Formula One seat, is now officially on the team's radar for a return.Schumacher, once part of the Haas F1 Team, transitioned to the World Endurance Championship under the Alpine banner after taking a role as Mercedes' reserve driver in 2023, which he has continued with alongside the WEC.During recent discussions about the team's future and driver lineup, Alpine Team Principal Bruno Famin confirmed Mick's potential inclusion for the 2025 season. Alpine currently faces uncertainty with their existing drivers, Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly, as their contracts are set to expire at the end of this year. This, compounded by the team's struggle to secure points in the current season, has led to broader considerations about their direction.Famin expressed great admiration for Schumacher's contributions within their World Endurance Championship team, highlighting traits beyond just his pace. He explained to the media during the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix weekend, as quoted by Formu1a.uno:\"He's one of the possibilities for sure. Like many, like many. Mick is doing an incredible job in endurance. What is very impressive is his mindset.\"Of course, he's fast, but I think everybody knows he's fast. It's not always useful to do a very good lap time \u2013 because you have the BoP [Balance of Performance] on top. You have to be a bit careful with the performance.\"The matter is not to evaluate the pure performance of the driver, but where Mick has been really incredible is his adaptation to the endurance mindset...\"Mick, from the very first minute, has been very, very cooperative, really helpful for his teammates.\"At the start of the year, Schumacher explained during an interview with Formula1.com that F1 will always be the dream. He explained at the time:\"I mean, it does include a lot of hair pulling and tearing, and I feel like you don't really see that.\"Obviously, this is the first media table that I've done this year [and] that shows a lot and says a lot in that sense, but F1 has always been a dream and it will always remain the dream.\"Again, there is no reason to stay here, not race, fall behind everybody... I would rather go out there, find something to race and develop my skills. In the end, if that leads to no way back into F1 but leads to another career, then I am happy to do that.\"",

But which games are the best on the upcoming schedule? Fans are tuned into the best matchups like crazy, but here are the three most underrated games on the Monday Night Football schedule for the year.While both of these teams aren't considered Super Bowl contenders entering the year, they both should be better than they were last season. Los Angeles brought in new head coach Jim Harbaugh to take the reins, while Arizona should have more health with quarterback Kyler Murray.Read more: Earn Cash Back When You Pay for Streaming ServicesAdding in that Arizona also has a potential star rookie at the wide receiver position, Marvin Harrison Jr., and this game could be very fun.At first glance, many will tune away due to the Commanders being here, but they have some excitement heading into a season for the first time in a long time. Not only does Washington have a new owner and head coach, but also a quarterback. Taking Jayden Daniels No. 2 overall in the 2024 NFL Draft gives this team a path forward and this will be the first primetime exposure of his career.With them playing the Bengals, it will be a battle of Heisman Trophy winners from LSU. Daniels will face off against Joe Burrow, with all eyes on him this season to see how he bounces back from an injury-riddled year. Don't sleep on this game, or you may miss a fun shootout performance.The Lions enter the season ready to push forward even more after winning their first playoff game in over 30 years and reaching the NFC Championship game. Anytime they are on primetime, people will tune in but it's the opponent that makes this game underrated here.Seattle has found ways to stay competitive over the years, even when they haven't had the best roster. Quarterback Geno Smith is a great story that many fans have latched onto, and they should be able to give the Lions a tough fight. The Seahawks have a few weapons on offense that may cause issues for the Lions defense, giving us a potentially grind-it-out battle early on.",

        "text": "Three-time F1 champion Max Verstappen clinched a tense victory at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, whilst also winning in the virtual Nurburgring 24 Hours event during the same weekend.This past weekend, Max Verstappen achieved a rare and impressive dual victory. The Red Bull Racing star not only took the top podium spot at the physically demanding Emilia Romagna Grand Prix but also emerged victorious in the virtual Nurburgring 24 Hours with Team Redline.The challenge of juggling an intense Formula 1 race weekend with a simultaneous commitment to a virtual endurance event is monumental. Despite a tricky start during the initial sessions at the iconic Imola circuit, Verstappen managed to maintain his lead from pole position and hold off the fast-approaching Lando Norris in the final laps.Parallel to his physical racing commitments, Verstappen participated as part of Team Redline in the round-the-clock virtual race. Verstappen's team, comprising four drivers, including himself, managed the virtual car through a series of shifts, ultimately leading to their victory. Verstappen commented to Autosport ahead of the race weekend:\"It's a 24-hour race and I think there are four of us on the car. But of course, I don't have a lot of time, Saturday night and Sunday morning.\"[I have] between two and four hours, if I'm going to do it. It depends a bit, how it works out with the times.\"You do have to go to bed on time and get your hours of sleep, of course, to start the Sunday well rested. You can't decide for everyone what they do on a Saturday night. People can go out for dinner, do crazy things...\"It's in my free time and I think I'm professional enough to see for myself what's OK and what's not OK.The reigning F1 champion continued:\"[If something goes wrong on Sunday] they'll say so. It doesn't matter to me anyway. Look, as I just said, I think I'm professional enough that I know what can and can't be done. If you don't go to bed and you don't sleep, it won't be good for your race on Sunday. But I think with so many years of experience I do know what to do.\"I do it all the time. I've also been gaming the last few races. None of that matters very much. But people don't talk about that because I haven't brought that up. This time I have.\"",

Schauffele has won the PGA Championship, beating Bryson DeChambeau on an incredible birdie putt to secure the victory.This victory for Schauffele comes after a disappointing final round in last week's Wells Fargo Championship. He finished second behind Rory McIlroy at -12 and shot at 71 in round four.Schauffele has secured his first career major victory. DeChambeau finishes second. The 30-year-old outlasted DeChambeau and Hovland in the final round after giving Schauffele a run for his money. Entering the final round, he was tied for the co-lead with two-time major winner Collin Morikawa. Many golf pundits and experts expected Schauffele to fold, because, well, that's what he tends to do. However, he flipped the script on the naysayers and posted a 6-under 65 in the final round to finish with a 72-hole total of 21 under.Sunday's round was the 11th wire-to-wire major win. Schauffele also recorded the lowest score to par in a major championship with (-21) over the 72-hole event to set a new record for the lowest score at a golf major. It was a back-and-forth type event as DeChambeau tied Schauffele at 20 under with a birdie on his 72nd hole; however, Schauffele matched it with his own dramatic shot on the par-5 18th.Schauffele's tee shot on the 18th fell just short of the bunker, leaving him with a tough stance where his feet were in the sand; it was a tough lie. However, nothing was stopping Schauffele from getting the job done as he ripped a long iron from 239 yards away. It was a beautiful strike that happened to stop 35 yards short of the green. The 30-year-old put himself in a great position to finish with a birdie; although he two-putted, it was enough to secure the victory. \nBefore Sunday, Schauffele was the only one in the top five of the world golf rankings without a major win. A birdie putt at Valhalla on the 18th hole of the PGA Championship secured him the win and $3.3 million.The 30-year-old won by one stroke at -21, with DeChambeau coming in at -20, followed by Norway native Viktor Hovland at -18, Germany native Thomas Detry at -15, and American Collin Morikawa tied for fourth at -15.The Southern California native finished round 1 with a score of 62, round two with a score of 68, round three with a score of 68, and round four with a score of 65. In total, he finished with only two bogeys, one double bogey, and 25 birdies.Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky is known for its exciting play and low scores. This past weekend, it lived up to its reputation. Schauffele finally is a champion. This could be the start of something special after finally getting over the hump.",

        "text": "I was recently shopping at my neighborhood pet store in Colorado when the clerk asked if I needed a bag. With two dogs pulling their leashes and an armful of new toys, I said yes. When she whipped out a paper bag, the state's ban on plastic bags came up.\"We had to throw out all our plastic bags due to the new regulations,\" she said.Wait, what!?The comment stunned me. I was sure the store staff would have used the remaining plastic bags rather than throwing them in the garbage. Why are plastic bags that have already been manufactured being sent to landfills rather than, perhaps, another state with less strict regulations?The seemingly knee-jerk decision to follow state regulations and dump perfectly fine bags into a landfill is emblematic of policies and practices driven more by optics than common sense while undermining real progress to make strides in cutting our carbon emissions.As corporations, governments, and citizens try to be more sustainable, they often fall prey to many misguided beliefs about sustainability, undermining the progress they hope to make.These are four sustainability myths that should be dispelled.Plastic waste is a huge problem \u2014 there is no doubt about that. But does banning straws and plastic bags really make a difference?You've probably heard about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a massive island of floating debris between Hawaii and California about three times the size of France. Most of it is plastic. But come to find out, most of this plastic isn't consumer waste. It actually comes from commercial fishing.Should we feel like Planet Killers every time we forget our tote bags at the grocery store? Not so fast. You will need to use those totes you have more than 7,100 times to neutralize their carbon footprint. So, do we have to feel awful about every consumer choice we make?First, plastic has real benefits \u2014 it extends food freshness, enables sterilized medical supplies, allows for cheap, versatile building material, and makes vehicles lighter, limiting the fuel they burn.The solution to plastic pollution is not to get rid of it like the well-meaning managers at my local pet store; it's being wise about how we dispose of it so it doesn't end up in our water and potentially injure wildlife. This will also require some major industrial attention.Organic food has swelled in popularity in the U.S. In 2022, sales of organic food were about $134.76 billion, up from nearly $18 billion in 2000. This has meant many consumers are buying healthier food, free of pesticides and chemical fertilizers.Organic food is clearly good for you, but how good is it for the planet? That's where it gets more complicated.Environmental experts consider organic farming a more sustainable alternative to traditional food production, resulting in better soil quality and reduced fertilizer or pesticide runoff pollution. But it has its trade-offs. For one, lower crop yields per acre mean more land is needed to grow the same amount of food. Organic food is considerably more expensive, limiting the number of people accessing it.Also, organic food goes to waste more easily. For example, GMO-developed FLVR SAVR tomatoes have been demonized because they were developed using science. But that science keeps the tomato from rotting faster and provides a longer shelf life. And there's no evidence that these FLVR SAVR tomatoes are unsafe. The only difference is that scientists helped speed up the evolutionary process.If you're a frequent flyer, a part of your carbon footprint may come from flying the friendly skies. The combustion of jet fuel in aircraft engines causes CO2 to escape into the atmosphere, making air travel a target of some climate change activists.Even celebrities committed to sustainability, such as Taylor Swift and Leonardo DiCaprio, have been criticized for gallivanting on their private jets.However, focusing on air travel as a major source of climate change misses the landing. Only about 2.4% of all global CO2 emissions come from planes. Compare that number to the 34% of carbon emissions emitted by electricity and heat generation and the 22% created by industry. Likely, Taylor's touring buses that schlep her production equipment from city to city are more of an issue than her private jet use \u2014 unless they are EVs. But then we get into our antiquated electrical grid...Sure, planes are a problem, which is why many airlines have pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But they're not an imminent threat. If you really want to impact the environment, drive less, walk, bike, and take public transportation more.Many believe that our consumer habits are driving climate change. They point to the 8,000 tons of wrapping paper, about 50,000 trees, used to wrap gifts yearly, or that household waste increases by more than 25% from Thanksgiving to New Year's.But while consumerism plays a small role in global warming, this argument shifts attention away from larger, more systemic causes.You can reduce the number of presents you wrap, but that will not dent the greenhouse gas emissions created by coal and other fossil fuels. You can also send fewer greeting cards, but that will have almost zero effect on the massive emissions from heating and cooling your home.The danger of focusing on consumerism as a foe is that it makes people feel guilty about doing something that doesn't make a difference anyway while diverting their focus from the things that matter.The bottom line: Be rational when it comes to sustainability. You don't have to be perfect. But you can be smart. Ask yourself, what's the one thing you can do to help save the planet today? Cut back on driving. Shop from your refrigerator. Reuse a plastic bag. It really does make a difference.",

        "text": "I've dedicated my career to helping healthcare organizations fill vacant executive-level roles. These openings require nuance; they need an understanding of healthcare, yes, but they also demand creativity, an affinity for data and an awareness of the unique industry that is healthcare.This is part of what makes hiring for these types of leadership roles so difficult \u2014 yet also so critical to an organization's success. From what to look for in candidates to how you can prepare your organization to bring in someone new, here are my top tips for successfully hiring healthcare executives:I see it often: Executives who excel in one healthcare system but flounder in another. As the hiring manager, you must deeply know who your organization serves, what makes it unique, and other dynamics that can influence the type of leader best suited to come on board. Some of these considerations may include:\u2022 Cultural differences\u2022 How people communicate across clinical/non-clinical functions\u2022 Bilingual communication needsBefore bringing in someone new, you must first make sure you have a plan to set them up for success. This should include the stakeholders that the new hire needs to meet, ample communication with affected team members, and a clear process for helping the new executive gain a deep understanding of the organization and their role within it.While specific metrics might be hard to define from the onset, having an established foundation of what you want your new addition to accomplish in their role is critical. It starts with knowing the pain points your organization is experiencing.For a chief nursing officer, this might be focusing on readmission rates and staff retention. For financial executives, knowing where your organization is losing the most dollars is key to repairing the damage. Aligning the overarching hurdle with the right person for the job is where success lies.There is tremendous art and science behind operating a successful healthcare system. The people you choose to lead yours should approach their work with this balance in mind.In my experience, candidates who are open to learning new things themselves and to teaching others are signs of a good fit. Those who are confident in their expertise yet willing to adopt new ideas and methodologies are often able to work well with others while still bringing their own value to the table.With constant advances in technology, artificial intelligence, regulations and more, look for someone open to embracing these changes and committed to staying abreast of them.From clinical data to operational metrics, the healthcare realm houses a lot of numbers and information. While this information is necessary for making ongoing business decisions, the candidates you consider for your C-suite should be able to balance this with the realities of working in a people-first environment.Employee burnout plagues the industry. Medical cases are complex. Healthcare is extremely individualized. Successful healthcare executives are those who not only understand this dynamic but balance it along with driving business objectives.Hiring for most positions \u2014 and especially executive positions \u2014 simply takes time. The unique demands of these types of roles, combined with the experience, education and personality required, can make finding the right candidate feel like an impossible task.I'm here to tell you it's not. Staying the course and not settling out of desperation can better serve your organization in the long run. The short-term discomfort the vacancy causes \u2014 even if it takes three, six or nine months to fill \u2014 is far less than the frustration that will ensue if your new hire exits the organization shortly after joining because they aren't a fit.The importance of hiring not just any healthcare executive, but the right executive, cannot be understated. By starting with a solid foundation of your organization and its needs, you can then be intentional about finding someone who can fill the gaps \u2014 and so much more.",

        "text": "In the last few years, we have experienced candidate-driven markets in America, but the trend started to change in 2023. In April 2024, Reuters, for example, wrote about another 7% increase in layoff announcements compared to March 2024.Candidates need to be ready for the changing landscape: until now, hiring managers have begged them to return to the offices at least a couple of days a week, and they offered record-high salaries just to get those seats filled. Job seekers must face the reality that this is no longer the case, and companies have options. Therefore, they must bring their A-game to stand out from the crowd. A good cover letter, for example, can help with that \u2014 so let's brush up on those skills! Here are six tips that can help anyone to shine!1. Be genuine. I know it does not sound so genuine, but let me explain. Recruiters are tired of getting cover letters that only focus on \"Here is my application; when can we meet?\" A good cover letter includes something that your resume does not. It can be anything, such as, to name a few, details about a relevant experience that is not on your resume because you gained it while volunteering, an article you read about the company's latest results or a quote from their founder that meant a lot to you.2. It is OK to brag. A good cover letter can help you get a meeting with the hiring manager, but only if something in it catches their interest. It is a good opportunity to mention a relevant, bombastic achievement that you are proud of, such as winning a sales contest or saving a significant amount of money for your firm. Feel free to use numbers and share some details, but make sure that you only disclose what you legally can.3. Drop names. A cover letter is also a great opportunity to mention a friend or former colleague you have in common with the hiring manager. Try to include people who would vouch for you \u2014 and make sure you tell them that you have applied to a role with someone from their network.4. Always review it. There is nothing more annoying than receiving a well-written cover letter with numerous grammatical or formatting issues. It is even more pathetic when the cover letter includes another firm's or hiring manager's name. Use the review function of your text editor software, or sign up for at least a free grammar checker program and find someone to read it before the submission. Nobody is perfect, but with all these tools, there is no excuse for being sloppy!5. Try to send a handwritten copy. I know. It is 2024, and people barely write anything with a pen on a piece of paper anymore. But this is exactly the reason why you should do it! As a recruiter, I receive handwritten cover letters and thank you notes maybe once every couple of years. Because it is so unusual, I do remember all those candidates even years after they wrote to me. It is personable, unique and more importantly, memorable.6. Call for action. At the end of the cover letter, you should ask for a meeting. Please make sure you do it politely but assertively. You don't want to sound desperate by saying you have multiple opportunities lined up, so you suggest getting together fast. Just confirm your interest level and ask for the opportunity to speak with the hiring manager. Please make sure you include your contact information!These are just some basic suggestions for those who want to take their job search to the next level. Some recruiters don't read cover letters at all, but when they do, you have a real chance to have your resume at the top of their piles!",

        "text": "There are few modern technological achievements as significant as those related to astronomy and space exploration. Such tools have increased our understanding of our solar system and beyond, yielding insights and discoveries previously relegated to the deepest confines of the imagination.As we grow to learn more about our solar system and beyond, the resources associated with these initiatives have also produced a variety of benefits for life on Earth, building a stronger, more informed society and establishing a firmer foundation for this technology's continued evolution.When considering the various technologies at play in today's space industry, the natural instinct is to look beyond \u2014 to distant planets, celestial phenomena, and other space-related matters that may one day produce answers to our most enduring scientific and existential questions. However, these resources are equally promising for present on-Earth living \u2014 especially within sustainability and planetary health.Prevailing satellite technology allows a clearer, more clarified view of Earth's climate, including \u2014 but not limited to \u2014 notable shifts in the planet's composition, metrics related to natural resources and emissions, and gauges associated with air and water quality. These capabilities expand to the tracking of natural disasters and other widespread planetary activity, giving us more time to allocate resources and project long-term impact.Space insights have also bolstered communication and digital connectivity worldwide. These shifts have been long-standing, exemplified by breakthroughs like satellite television and radio, but they have only grown quicker since their introduction. Now, as space-driven communication integrates with concepts like AI, 5G, and advanced analytics, it has helped create the most diverse, efficient network of interconnected digital pathways in the history of humankind.Concurrent trends exist within this revolution \u2014 everything from the cellular network innovations of Starlink to the process of developing leaner, more affordable satellites for the future \u2014 and their established and ongoing disruptions suggest far-reaching implications for tomorrow.Space technology is also the crux of space-related education; it has produced the findings and insights necessary to inform younger generations of planetary composition, celestial activity, aerospace, and other key concentrations making up our understanding of astronomy. The space industry's origins are perhaps the best evidence of this fact; even as initial space exploration became contentious and enigmatic, it spurred both interest and urgency within educational institutions.Science and engineering, in particular, saw increased participation and funding as the country fortified its space infrastructure and looked ahead to more ambitious ventures. While some of these changes were products of a dynamic and ever-changing historical period, they underscore a key fact: as space research grows, so too must its underlying personnel, and this is a positive self-feeding cycle as we reach farther beyond than ever before \u2014 with the education system benefitting as a result.The modern space industry continues to inspire tomorrow's astronauts, researchers, and aerospace engineers because it must \u2014 and as industry technology grows at a faster, more innovative rate, the above benefits stand to grow at a similar pace. This notion paints a future as plentiful for Earth as it is groundbreaking beyond the planet's confines.",

        "text": "In today's dynamic business landscape, fostering motivation within your marketing team is not just beneficial\u2014it's essential. A highly motivated team is the driving force behind business growth. But achieving and sustaining motivation requires more than just a pep talk or incentives; it demands a strategic approach that nurtures a culture of creativity, collaboration, and celebrationAside from hiring the right people with excellent marketing skills, how do you motivate your marketing team? Motivating others can be tricky, especially since the most effective motivation is intrinsic, not extrinsic\u2014it should come from within. In fact, research indicates that traditional extrinsic motivators\u2014rewards, incentives, or competition\u2014can actually diminish motivation by causing people to focus on what they will get for completing a task rather than on doing the task well or seeing the value in the task.With that in mind, here are five effective methods to boost motivation for a successful marketing team:Your marketing team culture plays a significant role in the motivation of team members. More collaborative environments encourage team members to support one another and allow for individual and team ownership of tasks, which is empowering and creates better buy-in from employees. However, where I see most leaders go wrong in creating collaboration is by encouraging competition between teams or individuals.Contrary to how it may seem, a competitive environment can significantly decrease motivation. Why? Competition is the opposite of teamwork. It encourages team members to work against one another \u2014 or even against the interests of the business as a whole \u2014 in pursuit of furthering their own interests. Competitions may seem like a fun way to boost motivation, but in the long run, they only reduce your team's potential.As a leader, it can be difficult to create intrinsic motivation in your team \u2014 after all, it has to come from inside them. That's why your role in motivating your team requires you to get to know them a little. The thing about intrinsic motivation is that it's a little different for everybody. We all have different drives, and sometimes we're not even aware of how these play out in our own lives. Sometimes, leadership requires a little sleuthing to discover those drivers within your team members, even if they're not aware of them.There are many assessments available that can help you understand your employees better, but often the best thing is just talking to them and getting to know them personally. When you take a genuine interest in your team as people and not just workers, you can quickly discover many of their drivers, which you can use to find ways to build their confidence and tie their personal motivations to their work.Whenever your marketing team completes a goal or reaches a milestone, take the time to celebrate. At my company, we have a Slack channel designated just for Wins! It's vital to morale in the long term. Celebrations can be motivating both intrinsically and extrinsically. On an intrinsic level, they create the space to recognize what's been accomplished, reflect, and prepare for the next steps. And on an extrinsic level, they provide something to look forward to.However, every person and team has different ways they want to be recognized and ways they want to celebrate. Make sure the way you celebrate wins aligns with their desires, or it won't feel like a celebration. If you offer some kind of reward, make sure it's something they really want. Celebrations go much farther in boosting morale and motivation when they mean something to the team, and often the best way to discover how your marketing team wants to celebrate is just to ask them.A culture that fosters creativity is one that's built on openness and appreciation rather than criticism and punishment. It requires an environment where people feel safe to experiment and fail, where they can offer up ideas without the fear of being shut down.People who are allowed to embrace and express their creativity in their work will tend to have more enthusiasm for what they do. After all, it's much more motivating to work on an idea you took part in developing and to have creative liberty in your work. Many marketing people are creatives at heart, and creativity is an asset to your business\u2014but it cannot emerge without a culture that makes space for it. You must give your team the freedom to try things and fail. Create a space where people can voice ideas and problems in a collaborative environment so they can work together to solve problems and develop their ideas.Burnout kills motivation and creativity. Be cognizant of your employees' mental health. There are many factors that lead to burnout, and overworking is just one of them. Burnout often stems from a lack of engagement or sense of purpose in work or from a working environment that feels draining. That's why your marketing team's culture is such an important factor in their motivation.Keep in touch with team members to understand how they're feeling and when they're headed toward burnout. When burnout comes from overworking, sometimes a little assistance or a break is all that's needed, but it often stems from deeper problems. If you develop strong relationships with team members and are willing to hear them out when they're facing a problem that's contributing to burnout, you can work toward solving those problems to create a more sustainable, motivating environment for your marketing team as a whole.Your marketing team is one of your most powerful business assets, and when you learn how to effectively motivate them, you can boost your business to new levels of success. Sustainable motivation stems from a collaborative, creative culture where team members can thrive in their creativity and are intrinsically motivated to bring their best work to the table every day.",

Asia will represent the largest share of global GDP growth at $90.6 trillion, followed by the developed economies at $82.9 trillion and then the rest of the world.Our recent exclusive interviews with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, masterfully conducted by our team led by Global Editor-in-Chief Nancy Cooper, are the latest example of this commitment. In this context, I see our role at Newsweek as not merely passive observers but as active facilitators of meaningful dialogue around the future of Asia.As an American who was born and lived the early part of my life in India, I have a nuanced perspective on India's challenges and aspirations. The country's relatively nascent sovereignty, having emerged only 75 years ago from centuries of colonial rule, is a testament to its resilience. The journey from its colonial past to a vibrant democracy is a narrative I hold close to my heart, and it drives my commitment to ensure that Newsweek covers India with the depth and nuance it deserves.Coverage of India by mainstream international media at times gravitates toward simplistic narratives that fail to capture the profound complexity and vibrant diversity of the world's most populous nation. Typically, the portrayal emphasizes either the booming IT and economic sectors or the persistent challenges such as poverty and social friction, leaving little room for the varied perspectives beyond and in between.Such coverage can overlook the rich cultural tapestry, the internal innovations in various sectors, and the distinct political dynamics, all shaped by thousands of years of history, that today stand at the nexus of geopolitical change. The level of optimism and pride I'm seeing among Indians\u2014friends, family, and colleagues\u2014is truly inspiring and unlike anything I've experienced before. The global stage is set to witness a confident India, and if the Indian diaspora's contribution to the U.S., the UK, and elsewhere is a preview, the world stands to gain much from India's rising prominence.That's why Newsweek's interview with Prime Minister Modi and the associated story was not just a recitation of current events: Our coverage delved into the complex dynamics of India's geopolitical relationships and their broader implications for global affairs.Modi's remarks to Newsweek on the Indo-China border disputes and his call for urgent resolution resonated globally, sparking reactions from major geopolitical players, including a direct response from the Chinese government. The response was immediate and extensive, with major news outlets like Bloomberg and BBC amplifying the discussion. The reaction from China was particularly significant, and its Foreign Ministry spokesperson highlighted hopes for diplomatic progress. This international engagement underscores the relevance of Newsweek's efforts and reaffirms our role in fostering meaningful global dialogue.A few weeks after our interview with Prime Minister Modi, we met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo. There, too, we gained fresh insights into the thoughts of a significant national leader and his approach to his country's challenges and opportunities.The interview explored the country's pressing need for stronger partnerships with the U.S. and other regional allies to address what he described as \"the most challenging and complex security environment since the end of World War II,\" a situation exacerbated by recent military activities by China and North Korea. Throughout the interview, he frequently emphasized the term \"peace,\" underscoring Japan's intent to be assertive yet remain a peace-loving nation, obeying international rules.It's our view that building a successful digital media company with global relevance today involves understanding political, economic, and social dynamics and committing to comprehensive reporting that resonates at the global stage and captures the evolution of the global order. In that respect, our recent India and Japan coverage serves as a kind of blueprint for Newsweek's global future. The impact of our interviews with Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Kishida and the accompanying stories highlights the critical role of media in international relations and democracy, reinforcing our commitment to journalism that not only reports but also enlightens.",

        "text": "Today, news media faces a number of structural challenges: deepening polarization, diminishing trust and a stark decline in reader engagement.At Newsweek, we've delved deeply into the forces driving us here. One way we're addressing these concerns is the Fairness Meter, which allows readers to hold us accountable by rating an article's fairness on a five-way scale. Our fairness meter can be found at the bottom of select articles across Newsweek's editorial content and will help maintain a high standard of integrity, transparency, and accountability.The landscape of polarization and eroding trustMedia's increasing polarization owes much to the dominance of social media, but the challenges began even before that with the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.This policy, which mandated the inclusion of diverse viewpoints, once ensured a breadth of perspectives in broadcast journalism \u2014 a formal balance that lent fairness and credibility to the format. Its removal marked the first shift toward what we see today: more extreme and polarized media narratives. Gallup's polls from 2021 and 2022 show that only 34% of Americans trust mass media, with a pronounced partisan divide \u2014 70% of Democrats versus a mere 14% of Republicans trust mass media outlets.This erosion of trust in news media is not an isolated phenomenon. It's part of a broader moment in which public confidence in many institutions has been waning. In an age when misinformation can spread rapidly over social media, the role of responsible media in providing accurate and unbiased information has become more important than ever. We must do what we can to restore this trust, and it begins at the core of the news product.Changing dynamics of reader participationParallel to the issue of trust is the evolution of reader participation. The digital age has transformed how audiences interact with news content.Post-2016 trends indicate a decline in engagement with traditional news outlets, particularly among younger demographics. Young people increasingly bypass traditional news platforms, turning instead to social media feeds and other digital channels for their news and information.This shift has significant implications for how news organizations engage with their audiences and maintain relevance in the digital era.The Fairness MeterNewsweek's Fairness Meter is one of our responses. First, it represents a commitment to deepening trust and enhancing reader engagement by involving our audience in the direct evaluation of our content. Second, the tool redefines the more traditional comment-based systems, instead opting for a structured and consistent way for readers to express their views on the fairness of our articles, providing a concrete method for readers to help shape and sharpen our journalistic tenets.Here's some of what we've learned after placing the Fairness Meter on over 1,000 stories since it was activated in September 2023.The aspirations of the Fairness Meter aim to go beyond just gauging perceptions of fairness. It's one step in the direction of restoring trust in the relationship between the public and the news media.Repatriating news engagement to the news propertyOver time, social media has usurped news organizations as the forum for discussion and debate of news and current events. One byproduct has been the formation of information echo chambers, which often come to confirm the existing biases of different groupings of users. Social platforms \u2014 with finely tuned algorithms designed to amplify engagement \u2014 frequently prioritize sensational and controversial content, perspectives and comments, fueling what could be referred to as \"enragement engagement.\"This shift has effectively taken over much of the discourse that was once a feature of news platforms. The Fairness Meter is an initiative to bring back reader engagement to the news platform itself.The end of the ivory tower: A call for public accountabilityThe modern media landscape needs a fundamental shift in how news outlets address reader perceptions and engagement. The era of the journalistic \"ivory tower\" \u2014 where media outlets operate in isolation from their audience \u2014 is over. Today's media must open itself up to public accountability. The Fairness Meter is one way of demonstrating this new approach, allowing readers to actively participate in shaping the stories our journalists report on.Ignoring the imperative for engagement and transparency comes with significant risks. The decline in public trust and reader engagement on news platforms is a clear signal. This growing distrust, exacerbated by digital echo chambers and social media-fueled confirmation biases, threatens the foundation of credible journalism.The Fairness Meter is not merely a feedback tool; it fosters dialogue and understanding and demonstrates respect for our audience's intelligence, acknowledging their critical role in shaping the way that we in the media work.Originally published on Poynter.org",

        "text": "In the annals of American broadcast journalism, the Fairness Doctrine stands as a testament to a time when balanced reporting was more than a noble pursuit; it was a mandated practice.The policy, established by the Federal Communications Commission in 1949, obligated broadcasters to present contrasting viewpoints on contentious public issues.This era of regulated balance came to an end in 1987 when President Ronald Reagan's FCC decided that the increasing diversity of media outlets meant the doctrine was no longer required. This pivotal shift laid the groundwork for significant transformations in the media landscape.In the post-Fairness Doctrine era, we have witnessed an unprecedented polarization of American media. Freed from the obligation to present differing perspectives, many media outlets have defaulted to presenting narratives through a singular ideological lens.The end of the Fairness Doctrine isn't the sole cause of media polarization, of course. The advent of social media and the algorithm-driven delivery of news, coupled with business incentives that prioritize engagement over balance, have exacerbated the divide. The outrage economy is a self-perpetuating system.These shifts have profoundly affected our democratic society. Public discourse, once anchored in a commonly accepted set of facts, has fractured into micro-environments, subsets and cohorts, each espousing its unique version of reality. This accelerates the erosion of civil dialogue, undermining a critical component of our democracy. In this polarized media landscape, trust in the so-called fourth estate has plummeted to an all-time low.Social media platforms, with their indiscriminate blending of content from trusted news outlets and dubious blogs, have furthered this erosion.The shift towards subscription-based business models is a double-edged sword. While it has provided a lifeline to many media organizations in the face of shrinking advertising revenues, it has also inadvertently deepened the echo chambers. By prioritizing content that affirms their subscribers' worldviews, media outlets perpetuate these bubbles. And with quality journalism often locked behind paywalls, the information divide grows wider, further threatening the democratic ideal of an informed citizenry.In the face of these challenges, it's crucial to remember that the principles of the Fairness Doctrine, though no longer legally enforced, needn't be abandoned. Instead, we should strive to voluntarily integrate these principles into our journalistic practices. By emphasizing fairness, balance and a representation of diverse viewpoints in our reporting, we can begin to counteract the rampant polarization that currently plagues our media and, by extension, our public discourse.Navigating today's media landscape is challenging. It's shaped by a web of social, technological and economic factors that defy easy solutions. Meanwhile, the erosion of civil dialogue, the declining trust in media, and the fragmentation of our public discourse pose serious threats to our democracy.We need to raise our journalistic standards. Both-sides-ism isn't fairness \u2014 it's a failure of critical thinking or intellectual honesty. Let's not be naive: There are people and interests who deliberately skew our public discourse through misdirection, false equivalence and outright lies. We must counter those pernicious efforts by demanding a commitment to good-faith debate, which will pay dividends in rebuilding the trust that across the spectrum of ideas.Adopting a voluntary commitment to the principles embodied in the Fairness Doctrine represents a step in the right direction. It signals our dedication to upholding the ethical tenets of journalism, our respect for diverse viewpoints and our unwavering commitment to nourishing an informed and balanced public discourse.When fairness is no longer a doctrine, it must become a practice. Our democracy, in its present state, urgently requires this shift. For the media industry, it's not just a question of ethical responsibility but an existential imperative. The very health of our democratic society might depend on it.Originally published on Poynter.org",
